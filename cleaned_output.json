I saw the GA1 quiz content and there are many topics that I don\u2019t know, there are videos pertaining to every question that we can watch and then solve the problems. So, my question is if we had to watch a video to solve the problem for most of them and were able to solve most of the problems should I consider taking the course or if I had to see the videos for most of the questions I should drop the course.

It starts off with an example that completely caught me off-guard.  The first video discussed an example that left me wondering why is the instructor even discussing all of that, at this point.  What\u2019s the context and the motivation?  Moreover, every slide is filled to the brim with text.  Can\u2019t decide whether to read it or listen to the speaker.  Neither does give me much understanding anyway.  It was filled with terminology that I\u2019m yet to pick up.  The speaker didn\u2019t apparently know much about who the audience is, and what are they aware of, and what they aren\u2019t\u2026In short, it failed to implement any of the very matter it speaks of - Understanding the problem.\nSummary.  I feel the course is offered too early.  Rather, I took it a little too early.\nDefinitely, I can\u2019t relate to most things the speaker is talking about.  At least, I don\u2019t see how and where the ideas will gel with our program.  I\u2019m sure it does, but now, I don\u2019t know how.\nSorry, I\u2019d never been as critical about anything as this one.  I just had to.  I\u2019m willing to hear different opinions.\nI\u2019m awaiting the announcement from IIT for the course drop.",

So, lesser chances to re-record them.\nThere are no live sessions planned yet for this course\u2026 the absence of enough sessions (especially given that it\u2019s a 2-credit course) will worsen the situation.\nFinally, I feel I might be able to better appreciate the technicalities and jargon if I finish all other ML courses before taking this up.",

With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.",

        "clean_text": "For TDS, you have to understand what the tools are and practise using them. Build little proof of concepts.\nHaving a separate dev environment is usually a good idea incase you mess up the system. WSL (if you are using windows) is usually a good option to do that because many of the tools are primarily linux tools.\nThis does not mean you cannot use another os. Just be prepared to face more challenges. MacOS typically is very similar to linux in the shell. Chief difference is usually not the commands but the installation method for software packages. Nearly any linux command and software package works the same in MacOS with some minor differences in only a very few cases.\nWindows is the worst of the bunch, because there are some tools that downright do not work on windows and the problems and instructions are usually completely different and including the commands for powershell. Be prepared for spending a lot more time if you are going windows only approach (without a linux vm or wsl). However if you are already comfortable with powershell and the cli quirks of windows then its fine.\nBottom line: there are no shortcuts. Practise the concepts. Start early. All the study material is fully available on the site before the term starts (last term). But remeber that TDS changes each term so make sure to check the current term material as well.\nKind regards\ntds.s-anand.net\nTools in Data Science",

There only\nsome\nnotable exceptions, and this is where formatted text is expected. This question\ndoes not\nrequire formatted text, but it does require handling of quotes.\nYour response has literal a\n\\\nand literal\nn\ncharacters. It fails the copy paste test. If it had the invisible actual new line characters encoded then it would be parsed correctly. In your own image that you shared you did not copy paste the return response of your function into your GA.\nI also looked at your repo and the mistake you made for this question was you used a multiline string for the SQL query. The result of the\njson.dumps\nfor this question (which does not require or expect formatted text) would end up with \\n that we do not parse. We are only parsing for quotes which our script does handle.\nAs a result, I would like to reiterate, your return fails the copy paste test.\nTherefore we will not be able to award you marks for this. There are many students who got this correct. I suggest you to check out some of their repos to see why they were able to get the right answer.\nKind regards\nTDS Team",

        "clean_text": "@carlton\n@s.anand\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\nSir\nI wanted to respectfully bring to your attention a concern regarding the evaluation of my Project 2 submission.\nMy project is functioning properly in my browser, but it doesn\u2019t use\nhttp\nor\nhttps\nin the URL\u2014it\u2019s accessed directly without a protocol. I believe this might have caused an issue with the evaluation script, rather than an actual error in my submission. I\u2019d like to kindly request that the evaluation script be updated to account for such cases, as the core requirements of the project were fulfilled to the best of my understanding.\nWith due respect, I\u2019ve invested a lot of time and effort into this project, and it\u2019s disheartening to see that a technicality might affect the evaluation. We\u2019ve studied exception handling in both Java and Python\u2014so I was a bit curious (asking respectfully, of course!) why there wasn\u2019t similar handling in the evaluation logic for edge cases like mine. I completely understand the depth of your knowledge, and I say this with all humility\u2014I\u2019m just trying to understand and express a genuine concern.\nI don\u2019t have professional experience in web or app development, but my cousin, who works in tech, told me that even in real-world projects, bugs can appear after deployment. That\u2019s why we have QA and support teams in companies (or so I\u2019ve been told!).\nTo be honest, I initially thought TDS would be\neasier\ncompared to Java, PDSA, or SC. Ironically, I\u2019ve cleared all four subjects this term, including both projects\u2014except TDS, where Project 2 has become a bit of a nightmare. Without the Project 2 score, I might end up passing with just an \u2018E\u2019 grade, which would hurt my overall CGPA. Worse, I\u2019d have to repeat the course and pay the fee again\u2014which isn\u2019t covered under the CSR fund.\nSo, with the utmost respect and sincerity, I request you to please consider re-evaluating my submission using the updated endpoint. Not just for me, but there are several students whose hopes are resting on this project\u2019s score. Updating the script shouldn\u2019t affect students who already scored well, but it might help a few others avoid repeating the course unnecessarily.\nI\u2019m not asking for bonus marks or any special treatment\u2014just a fair second look. As a law student (LLB), I deeply respect rules and processes. I only ask this in the spirit of fairness and with full respect for your time and effort.\nPlease consider this message as a humble and respectful request\u2014I\u2019m just exercising my right to politely express a concern.",

This is inconsistent with your claim that my score has already been updated.\nI have previously submitted a formal discrepancy form for two questions that were incorrectly evaluated by the Project 2 evaluation script. Furthermore,\n@carlton\nhas explicitly confirmed that the marks for these questions would be updated. To date, this correction has not been implemented and my score hasn\u2019t updated.\nThe marks in question are not trivial. If the corrections are made as promised, my overall course percentage will increase by a minimum of 6%. This is a substantial change that directly affects my academic record. The assertion that \u201cmore marks will not change the grade\u201d overlooks the broader implications of accurate and fair assessment.\nIt is a fundamental principle of academic integrity and fairness that students receive the marks they have rightfully earned. Denying the correction of a clear and acknowledged error constitutes an unjust deprivation of my rightful academic standing. Such actions may not align with the principles of due process.\nI respectfully request that you to update my Project 2 score to accurately reflect the corrections as confirmed by\n@carlton\n, provide a clear clarification of my revised Project 2 score (out of 100) and ensure that my overall course percentage is recalculated accordingly.",

I have completed all subjects in Diploma and I am experienced in programming so it went well for me.  But students who are doing this subject early in their Diploma will find it pretty difficult especially Project 2 . So, one suggestion would be to add prerequisites for this subject and suggest them to take TDS in their last term.\nThe End Term was easy but there was no point on adding a question to calculate a lengthy expression manually to calculate distance. It proves nothing except that I am good at mathematics.\nSpecial mentions to\n@carlton\nfor those great live sessions. That really helped !\nThat as well. Thank you again.\nAmit.",

I only 1.5 grace marks to pass this course. I didn\u2019t knew the difficulty of this course because the rating of this course on discourse is wrong. So I took this subject but wasn\u2019t able to give proper time to it. Somehow I managed to do the course but due to only 1.5 marks, I am not able to pass the course. I have only 4 course left, So if I pass this course I\u2019ll be able to complete diploma by next term. Further sir, I do not fall under any fees relaxation policy, So sir I have to pay the same fees again for the same course.  So it\u2019s a huge request sir to grant me some grace marks to pass the course. If the difference was more I wouldn\u2019t request at all. Even sir in the last term I repeated MLT because the difference was high and I couldn\u2019t make it but I managed to pass it in this term. Sir I request you grant me some grace marks. My score is 38.6 so If you grant me 1 marks and round it off. then sir I\u2019ll be able to pass it and will finish diploma by next term. Sir it is huge request sir. Please consider it as exception and sir this will be my last request because I respect your decision and will not make any further request.\nThank you sir\nsincere regards",

        "clean_text": "Having a coding background, the first GA seemed really easy. So I started the course thinking that it\u2019ll be an easy S grade course for me. Oh how wrong was I!!\nThe sleepless nights cursing my laptop for freezing while my docker image installed huge CUDA libraries with sentence-transformers; and then finding ways to make sure it does not, and then getting rid of the library itself, it\u2019s just one example of how I was forced to become better by finding better solutions to multiple problems. This is one of the hardest, most frustrating and the most satisfying learning experience I\u2019ve ever had, besides learning ML from Arun sir.\n@s.anand\nsir did a tremendous job of designing this course. I feel this course ties every other course together by applying learnings from each course and building further upon them. I learnt development in python and APIs in MAD-1, JS in MAD-2, bash scripting in SC, SQL in DBMS, data structures in PDSA and TDS had applications of each. In MAD projects, we made an app and submitted it as zip file. Here we went on to learn to containerise our app and deploy and also make the process automated. Our apps combined python and shell scripting along with the power of LLMs. Yeah the projects did seem extremely overwhelming but the learning is invaluable.\n@Jivraj\n@Saransh_Saini\n@carlton\nI\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t an easy task being the TA of this course. Thanks for all the help throughout the term with the Mock ROEs, project sessions and clearing doubts in discourse and live sessions.\nI still got an S grade but it was a very hard-fought S with the help of some luck. I\u2019d love to follow the changes this course goes through in the upcoming terms.\nThanks\nRegards,\nShivaditya Bhattacharya",

This post reminds me of the farewell post I wrote for my TAs\n@carlton\nand\n@Amit1\nback in May\u201924 term when I was a student of TDS. This course is more of an experience that a student goes through. The sleepless nights for projects, the thrill and rush of the ROE, and the satisfaction of an easy End Term\n.\nThis course builds the confidence within a person to face challenging scenarios and a believe to come at the top of it. Honestly, I learnt a lot about being a TA in this course. It was an experience worth living. So, thank you Shivaditya, looking at students like you, it feels like our efforts paid off.\nAll the best for your next term.\nBest Wishes\nSaransh Saini\nTDS TA",

        "clean_text": "This course was the most exciting and memorable of all the courses I have taken so far (actually of all the courses in the diploma level, I have completed all\nby now ). I had the technical background and as\n@22f3000819\nmentioned I thought it was going to be an easy ride but I was wrong. It was challenging as well as fun at the same time.\nThe best part of the course is that it is open internet and we are free to explore, use LLMs and get the things done. This way of learning to me is the most effective. I have the guide and now I can devise how I should approach the things.\nEverything ROE, Project 1, Project 2 was quite challenging and fun at the same time. Projects were the best part of the course. I learned how things can go wrong when we deploy it. I collaborated with\n@ItsMeAlex\n,\n@trebhuvansb\n,\n@23f1002382\nand\n@22f3002933\nfor Project 2.\nMy Project 2 repo even got 17 forks and 4 stars and scored 20/20 on evaluation. This adventure ended with the relaxing end term paper and an overall \u201cS\u201d grade.\nAlso I must say the support team of TDS is the best so far in the program. I had conversation with\n@Jivraj\n,\n@Saransh_Saini\nand\n@carlton\nsir and they are super helpful. I would really miss these sessions. I attended the live sessions by\n@s.anand\nsir and sir\u2019s take on the questions were really insightful and even made me think differently than my perspective.\nWhen we do something different it ought to have challenges both operational and technical but the TDS support team tried to give its best. Many a times I too had raised concerns but the team tried to resolve it to their best capabilities.\nAt last I would like to say, without any hesitation, I had experienced the best part of the program till now in the last 3-4 months. Hoping to meet the team and my fellow peers in person during the Paradox\n.\nThanks & Regards\nPradeep Mondal",

Why? Because curiosity got the better of me, and I thought, \u201cEh, GA1 went fine, how hard could it be?\u201d\n(Spoiler: Very hard.)\nNot a decision I recommend unless you\u2019re into academic masochism.\nThe first few modules hit me like\nthree courses merged into one\n. Maybe because I was totally unprepared, maybe because TDS has a secret pact with chaos.\nDid all 7 GA \u2026it was very time consuming but fun too \u2026learnt new tools with every question. But hey, the\nlive lectures\nwere fantastic\n, the\nmodules were well-structured\n, and thank goodness for the lifesaving\nDiscourse forum and group\n, where the real MVPs reside\n.\nThen came\nProject 1\n. Ah yes, my nemesis. I\u2019d write code,\nit would run perfectly\n, then\u2014bam! A random error just to keep things from getting doable\u26a0\ufe0f. Was it\n404? 500? Who knows!\nI basically developed muscle memory for every error code in existence\n. The grand result?\n2/20.\nAt this point, my grade looked like it had fallen off a cliff\n, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I could\nsalvage an B\u2014or even a C, honestly\n\u2026 with -18 in my balance due to P1 and a trauma for P2 I couldn\u2019t have expected more\u2026 no?\nEntered the\nTA sessions and peer-powered survival squad\n\u2014my saving grace.\nROE, the supposedly impossible exam\n, where I thought even a 50% would be a miracle?..got\n100%.\nSame for\nProject 2\u2014100%.\nEven after initially refusing to believe it, reality set in, and my **end-term score also landed around 90 ** (thanks to the PYQs and those 300 github ques\u2026definitely recommending the next term student to solve and understand all the pyqs fr), then wrapping the final score with some gift wrappers of a few bonus marks\u2026 this deal got sealed with a confident A \u2026\n.\n\u2026drumrolls\u2026\nAn\nA.\nThis course was\nbrutal\n, but in the best way possible\n. It threw me into battles with\nLLMs, never-ending questions\n, and existential crises over debugging\n. But now, I have actual\nskills\n(and scars) that I\u2019ll carry into my future projects of MAD1, MAD2, MLP, and BDM which will be a whole new experience\ud83d\ude80.\nLooking back, the syllabus was\na wild mix of survival skills and superpowers\n\u2014building models, deploying them, wrestling with LLMs, and somehow convincing messy data to behave. And just when we thought we had conquered it all, Project 1\npulled us into the abyss\n. Now, with Data Analysis and Visualization still in the works, the adventure wasn\u2019t over. Because what\u2019s data science without\nsome surprises and flashy charts to flex?\nFor future students?\nTake it\nlater in the diploma\n, enjoy the\nmad ride\n, and remember\u2014\neven if you bomb a project, there can always be a comeback.\nTDS is tough, but resilience matters more than perfection.\nEven if you get 10/100(which I got) on a project, learn from it, adapt, and come back stronger.\nMassive thanks\nto\n@s.anand\nsir for making this learning experience possible, and a special shoutout to\n@carlton\nsir,\n@Saransh_Saini\nsir, and\n@Jivraj\nfor patiently resolving our\nchaotic\nissues\n.\nYour guidance made a challenging journey both rewarding and insightful.

        "clean_text": "Hi\n@carlton\nand\n@Jivraj\nsir,\nI appeared for the end term examination held on 13th April 2025 during the FN shift. I would like to bring to your attention that the exam interface did not provide an option for multiple selections. However, a few questions appeared to have multiple correct answers.\nI have noted down the specific questions and the corresponding options I believe to be correct.So, kindly review them and let me know if there were any errors in my understanding of the questions. The questions are as follows:\n1000042547\n1080\u00d7578 187 KB\nQuestion 2: Fields needed to filter \u201cPOST requests under /images/ from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays\u201d\nTo filter such logs, we need:\nTime \u2192 for the hour and the day (Monday)\nMethod \u2192 to filter POST\nURL \u2192 to filter /images/\nSo, the correct minimal set is:\nTime, Method, URL\nTime \u2192 needed\nMethod \u2192 needed\nURL \u2192 needed\nReferer \u2192 not needed, but not harmful\nSo this option includes all the necessary fields, just with one extra \u2014 which doesn\u2019t invalidate it.\n1000042548\n1080\u00d7301 71.5 KB\nAcc to solutions only option 6406534159827 is valid:\nStatus is numeric (200)\nMethod (GET), Protocol (HTTP/1.1), and URL (/index.html) are correct\nAll required fields are present and properly formatted\nThe other options were as follows:\n9825 uses invalid protocol (INVALID)\n9826 uses invalid status code (OK instead of numeric)\n9824 has no critical issue \u2014 it is technically also valid (only uses a private IP 192.168.1.1, which is unusual but not invalid). So both 9824 and 9827 are valid, but the answer marked only 9827\n1000042545\n1079\u00d7468 35.7 KB\nCorrect Answer(s):\nPUT \u2013 Correct: It replaces the resource entirely. Multiple identical PUTs = same result.\nGET \u2013 Also correct: It only fetches data, no side-effects. Multiple GETs = same result.\nDELETE \u2013 Technically correct: Deleting the same resource multiple times has the same result as deleting once (resource stays deleted).\nIncorrect Answer:\nPOST \u2013 Not idempotent. Each POST usually creates a new resource or changes server state.\n(This is the mistake on my part that I put the ans as POST as I thought since 3/4 are idempotent and one is not I should select the odd one out but I hope this could be resolved)\nThank you",

        "clean_text": "Thank you for the clarification provided regarding Question 4 and resolution of errors in other questions. I understand the reasoning behind choosing Option A (Time, Request, Method, URL). However, I respectfully believe Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) is more accurate for the following reasons:\nRedundancy in Option A:\nThe Request field already contains the HTTP method, URL, and protocol (e.g., \u201cPOST /images/logo.png HTTP/1.1\u201d). Including both Request and separate Method and URL fields introduces redundancy. If we already extract Method and URL separately for filtering, the full Request field becomes unnecessary.\nSimplicity in Filtering:\nFiltering for \u201cPOST requests under /images/\u201d from 15:00 to 18:00 on Mondays can be done using:\nTime \u2192 for checking the hour and weekday.\nMethod \u2192 to filter only POST.\nURL \u2192 to ensure the request is under /images/.\nThus, Option C (Time, Method, URL, Referer) already includes all needed fields. While Referer is not essential, it doesn\u2019t interfere with the filtering and might be useful in future extended filtering cases (e.g., source tracking). Therefore, Option C is complete and accurate without being redundant.\nConsistency with Log Parsing Practices:\nIn most log analysis scripts or systems (e.g., Python\u2019s re or pandas parsing of logs), Method and URL are parsed from Request for separate use. This further supports the idea that including Request alongside Method and URL is not best practice.",

However, what about those of us who completed all 6 assignments but missed GA7 for some reason?\nAs the course is quite challenging due to the vast syllabus, bonus marks would be really helpful for many of us.

Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.\nNow I\u2019m seeing in groups that there\u2019s an \u201cextra benefit\u201d being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.\nI could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief \u2014 grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.\n@carlton\n, we request you to kindly consider this matter.

There was no mention of any bonus marks, and we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7 before the deadline. Because of other academic commitments like Project 2, some of us couldn\u2019t complete GA7.\nRecently, we found out that some students received an email saying they\u2019ve been given +5 bonus marks for GA7, which directly affects their final score and possibly their overall grade. Since this information wasn\u2019t shared earlier, we kindly request you to consider offering an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn the bonus marks. This could be through a submission review or another form of assessment.\nWe genuinely hope for your understanding and would be very grateful if you could provide a chance for us to earn the bonus marks too.\nBest regards,\nPalaash V.

Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These \u201cminor\u201d things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards",

The keys to a successful Project 1 are:\nDeliverables,\nand\nan example\nof the Evaluation has been provided.\nIf your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.\nScreenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am\n1764\u00d71764 374 KB\nPlease read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.\nSo the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.\nKind regards",

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1. Graded Assignments (GA)\nGA6 Doubts Unresolved:\nWhile doubts related to Q1 and Q2 have been addressed, other queries remain unresolved despite being posted in the GA6 thread . The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided.\n(Thread link)\nGA Platform Changes:\nInitially, we were solving questions on\nexam.sanand.workers.dev\n. However, in GA6, we moved to\nSeek\nand in GA7, to\nGoogle Forms\n. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n2. Project Updates\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2:\nThere are multiple doubts posted in the\nProject 2\ndiscussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet. Without these clarifications, it is difficult to proceed with the project. Could you please provide an expected timeline for when these queries will be resolved?\n(thread link)\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nI appreciate your time and assistance in addressing these concerns. Looking forward to your response.\nBest regards,\nLakshay",

The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\nThe course is in transition. Initially all of it used to be on seek portal. But there were limitations of seek portal that we were not able to work around to deliver the kind of interactive, reactive and rapid corrections/iterations that are now possible because we moved the evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\nlakshaygarg654:\nProject 1:\nThe result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines. We are taking the matter with utmost seriousness. Its just that we cant always keep you up to date on every set back we are facing.\nEach and everyone of us are concerned about Project 1 and are working on it. Anand, JK, Prasanna, myself, Jivraj and Saransh. We all have been given access to the eval server which we only managed to provision a few days ago and we are all trying to get the most ambitious TDS project evaluation out the dry dock and into the water and hoping it floats gracefully rather than sink in the estuary. Meanwhile we are busy patching the pipes in the belly of the ship while its rolling down the slipway.\nlakshaygarg654:\n3. ROE Score Update\nWhile ROE scores may not be a primary concern, the bonus marks in ROE have still not been updated on the student dashboard. It would be helpful to get confirmation on when these will be reflected.\nYou got the maximum possible mark in ROE. Does it not show you got 100 in ROE in the dashboard? I have been told by operations that it has been pushed.\nKind regards",

We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2.

Thanks for the opportunity to share my thought process.\nWhat does this RoE evaluate?\nImplicit learning.\nImplicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer if woken up from sleep?\u201d\nExplicit learning is \u201cHow much can they answer given time and Internet?\u201d\nSome may know 10% implicitly. Some know 50%. They\u2019ll answer those in a few seconds.\nSome, they can FIND out. with Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT. That\u2019s explicit learning. But it takes time.\nSome, they just CAN\u2019T find out. Maybe the terminology is unclear. Maybe their skill set is different.\nThe RoE evaluates how much of learning is implicit. (Projects test how much is explicit.)\nCan you answer 17 Q in 30 m?\nHopefully not.\nI hope this is at the edge of the class\u2019 competence. If multiple people answer all 17, I\u2019ll suggest 20 Q in 30 m next time, or pick tougher questions.\n(This sounds harsh. Over time, though, I\u2019ve come to value frank feedback over polite encouragement.)\nWhat knowledge helps solve it this fast?\nPractice.\n3 strategies help.\nConsistent practice\n. Practice regularly. Pick problems just outside the edge of competence (fail 50% of the time).\nSocial learning\n. Observe experts & peers and internalize their strategies. We\u2019re social animals and learn faster through mimicry.\nEmotional engagement\n. If we like it or enjoy it, we learn faster. Practicing on real-world problems or problems we enjoy solving, working with people we enjoy, helps.\nIs it worth it?\nMaybe not.\nNot all implicit learning is worth it.\nYou may not need it. 10 years ago, as a data scientist, scraping was worth learning implicitly. Today, as a manager, I\u2019d just hire someone to do it.\nYou may not be good at it. When I got a \u201cD\u201d in German, followed by a \u201cD\u201d in Japanese, I realized I\u2019m just not mentally wired for human languages. It\u2019d be too much effort to learn.\nThe RoE scores will give an idea of your implicit learning.\nBut your time is limited. Implicit learning is costly. Please focus your time judiciously.",

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction \u2192 Data Cleaning \u2192 Data Transformation \u2192 Data Analyisis \u2192 Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday\u2019s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best to reduce this factor by getting used to the clock.\nKind regards",

        "clean_text": "Hello Sir,\n@s.anand\n@carlton\nAs TDS is one of the most important courses in the data science diploma, I respectfully want to bring up a concern. The TDS roe exam is almost impossible to solve within the given time frame. While the team might aim to develop certain skills in students, I would like you to consider this: having an exam that is nearly impossible to complete in the allotted time which is a statement by your side\u2026\nMy question is, why is this exam graded and carrying  20% weightage towards the final grade? Is this fair? we are loosing marks for the exam in which almost no one can score average. This situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly. I request the team to consider this issue. Either make this exam ungraded or reduce its weightage. This is a very serious issue, as many of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.\nThank you for your consideration.",

Given the challenging nature of the test, it seems quite difficult to complete all the questions within the allotted 45 minutes.\nI believe even the course team would find it challenging to solve this exam in such a short time frame.\nPerhaps considering a percentile-based grading system could be a fairer approach, as it would better reflect the relative performance of all students.\nThis way, we can ensure that the grading is equitable and does not unfairly impact our CGPAs. I hope the team can consider this suggestion.",

        "clean_text": "@23ds1000034\n@nandanreddyp\nTDS ROE is a reality check on your true skills. Rather than face FAANG type tests when it really matters and get a shock that you are at the bottom of the pile, it is better you face reality now in an environment that does not unduly penalises you.\nThis situation is causing CGPAs to drop significantly.\nWhile that seems like a nice sound bite, let\u2019s look at the data as true data scientists rather than let emotion lead our thoughts.\nIf you get an S in TDS, its weight to your total Diploma CGPA will be 5.55%.\nWhen you consider that ROE is worth 20% of that, the overall effect on your diploma CGPA at BEST is 1.11% if you score 100% in it. The TRUE effect\nis lower\nif you take into consideration you can offset at least 25% of that loss with bonus questions (worth 5% of the TDS grade)!\nThis is a very serious issue\nA little over dramatic a statement considering the data we now have considered above. The  reality is the ROE is worth 0.83% of your overall diploma CGPA (and that too this is the worst case, i.e. for direct diploma students! For those that started from foundation its impact\nis even smaller! 0.52%)\nWhat is my opinion on ROE? It made me a better student. I was truly humbled by the experience. It gave me a realistic view of my abilities and the level I need to attain so that I can be confident in the value I am adding to the client. Who is the client? The businesses I might deal with, the companies I contract for.\nIf there was no value attached to the ROE (i.e. you have no stake in it) then all the evidence points to one very simple truth. Nearly no one taking it seriously.\nmany of us are struggling to maintain good CGPAs to progress to the degree level.\nMy mother has always said one thing to me. Its only an undergraduate degree. If you are struggling in year 2, then stop wasting your time, its not meant for you.\nROE is not harsh. ROE is like my mother\u2019s very wise advice. There are many, many examples of students dropping out of university and being successful in life.\nDo not waste your time,\nits more valuable than anything you possess. If you are struggling, to even maintain a 6 CGPA requirement to enter the degree level because of an ROE that contributes > 0.834%, then the very best advice you will ever receive from me is: Do not waste your time with this degree.\nI say this with all sincerity and truth. I am living evidence, as are many others, you do not need this degree to succeed in life. The reason I am doing this degree is because I realised that I actually enjoy this course and I find real value from it and hope to make a difference for good with what I learn from it.\nAlthough it is called the impossible exam, our data shows that there are several students that have done well in the ROE. ROE is not harsh. It\u2019s a reality check, its a mother\u2019s advice and a very inexpensive, truthful and effective one.\nHumbly for your kind consideration",

        "clean_text": "@carlton\n, we are mixing something straightforward as the ability to score an S or A grade in TDS with a philosophical outlook on the topic.\nThe philosophy is helpful if the grades for most students are following a standard bell curve (average of all subjects or average of TDS over the last few semensters) and a few students are outliers in terms of the grading. For e.g., if I score a lower than expected grade and I am feeling demotivated, I can understand what you just wrote and it is indeed very much to the point.\nHowever, if the entire grading bell curve has shifted and most students are not scoring grades as per expectation, it is time for the instructors to consider whether the grading pattern needs to be tweaked (20% for an \u201cimpossible\u201d ROE is perhaps on the higher side) or students need to be provided with alternate paths to a decent grade (like extra assignments for 10-20 marks in lieu of the loss of marks above mentioned ROE).\nI would like to reiterate that my observations above are only w.r.t. a standard grading bell curve for all subjects or for TDS from previous terms.\nDo note that all IITs follow normalization of marks and grades as a standard activity so that students can focus on learning and giving it their best rather than worrying about grades. This is not the case in this course, so we should think about alternative grading patterns without compromising on the rigour of the course in any way.",

RoE has been really tough since the past 3 terms at least (I haven\u2019t checked with students who did it before that, so I don\u2019t know about those). Or if the issue is a bell curve mismatch between different subjects, we shouldn\u2019t be expecting that to be perfect. Some of the subjects were extremely easy, but nobody complained about those\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I also felt it was tough beyond reason. These sort of exams where the time required far exceeds the time given is more typical of competitive exams where the score isn\u2019t important, only your rank is. All that being said, I still didn\u2019t complain since the difficulty is \u201creal\u201d, and not made-up like with BDM theory/project. With the first, the difficulty comes from an extremely poor grading system, and with the second, from having to find a business that will share data. The subjects themselves don\u2019t pose a significant intellectual challenge.\nAlso, is an S at TDS really hard this term? I scored one last term despite a poor RoE performance. I\u2019m unable to recall now whether they gave us some extra marks out of pity\nPS: There is no implication from any of my remarks that I will stop sharing RoE jokes/memes",

I don\u2019t know how you got an S in spite of a poor ROE.

The\nlive sessions and guidance\nhave been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\nLack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any\nprerequisites\n, leading many students\u2014including those from\nnon-technical backgrounds\n\u2014to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the\ncourse content, assignments, and projects\nhave been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe\ndifficulty of the projects\nhas been overwhelming, requiring most of us to\nrely heavily on peer support\njust to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined\nTDS\nbased on past\nDiscourse posts and feedback\n, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition\u2014especially for\nworking professionals\nand students without prior experience.\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort\u2014spending\n2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs)\nto secure good scores\u2014we still find ourselves\nstruggling to meet expectations\nfor the\nprojects and RoE\n, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.",

This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\nMany students pursuing this course are\ndual-degree students or working professionals\n, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe\nlast-minute guidance\nfor projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe\nstructuring and scheduling of sessions\nfeel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\nEarly guidance and detailed instructions for Project 2\n, well in advance of the deadline.\nMore structured and accessible support\n, considering the diverse student base, including working professionals.\nBetter management of exam difficulty levels\n, ensuring that assessments are fair and reflect actual learning rather than being unnecessarily tough.\nI hope these concerns can be taken into account, and necessary improvements can be made. Looking forward to your response.",

        "clean_text": "Thank you\n@A_LAKSHMI\nfor the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the\ngrading pattern will not be changed\n.  And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this\nDiscourse thread\nwhere students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the\nfirst page of the TDS course\nGA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\nThis course is quite hard\nHere\u2019s students\u2019 feedback:\nIt\nused\nto be an easy course until 2024.\n#\n#\n#\nNow it\u2019s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n#\n#\n#\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n#\n#\n#\nLLMs grade you \u2013 unpredictably.\n#\n#\nThe ROE is hard.\n#\nTake Graded assignment 1\nto check if you\u2019re ready for this course.\nPlease drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It\u2019ll be too tough for you now.\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this -\nSurviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou\nCAN\ncopy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\nWhy should you copy?\nBecause in real life, there\u2019s no time to re-invent the wheel. You\u2019ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It\u2019s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand\nwhat you\u2019re copying. If you\u2019re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach\nwhat you\u2019ve learnt.\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a\nnice blog\nwhere [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable  and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is -\nTools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just \u201ctools\u201d, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them\nThe point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\n@22f2001640\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn\u2019t be easy. But I see that the TDS course team members have been putting their heart and soul in this course (and support), and even in this week they have prepared 3 sets of ROEs in order to ensure that all of you get enough practice opportunity.",

We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards",

So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards",

ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question.

Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/clean the data and you will have to gain some information from the data, is what typical ROEs test.\nKind regards",

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure\u2019s voice emerged from the gloom, \u201cYou are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.\u201d\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal\u2014a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund\u2019s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda\u2019s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor\u2019s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor\u2019s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"",

Here are the highlights of the discussion:\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team",

(Some have Gate exam on Saturday also). So, extending the timeline to at least Sunday, 16th Feb would be truly appreciated.\nWeek 3 release date timeline is 24 Jan, we need adequate time to go through the weekly materials. All the contents are already released, so by the same logic upcoming Project 2 contents are also available but that doesn\u2019t mean that we can complete the upcoming project within a week.\nProject help sessions came on 11th February(live) and 12th Feb on YouTube, just 4 days before the submission date, though I am not complaining about this and genuinely appreciating the team\u2019s effort, but this does gives very less time for many of us here.\nThank you.",

        "clean_text": "Hi Vikram,\nThis is because (if you watched the session, or examined the code, you would have realised that) datagen.py was designed to run inside your docker container. And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only\u2026 please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards",

        "clean_text": "Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards",

        "clean_text": "Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn\u2019t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I\u2019d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.",

        "clean_text": "Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation\n\u2013 Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility\n\u2013 A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability\n\u2013 You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n\u2022 Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n\u2022 Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n\u2022 Best for\nreproducibility\nand\ncollaboration\nsince others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n\u2022 Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer\u2019s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n\u2022 If you\ndon\u2019t specify a version\n, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n\u2022 If you\ndo specify a version (package==1.2.3)\n, you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n\u2022 If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n\u2022 Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n\u2022 Using\ngreater than/less than constraints\n: package>=1.2,<2.0 (allows updates but avoids major version changes).\n\u2022 Running pip freeze > requirements.txt after confirming a stable environment.\nBest Practices Summary\nAlways use a virtual environment (e.g., venv or conda).\nUse a\nrequirements.txt\nfile for reproducibility.\nPin versions cautiously\u2014avoid unnecessary strict versioning unless needed.\nPeriodically review and update dependencies to prevent using outdated or insecure packages.\nKind regards",

        "clean_text": "For some projects where there are many dependencies, like an ML project or flask app, it\u2019s better you mantain a virtual environment since the dependencies are interconnected with their versions.\nWhereas for some simple projects, with less dependencies, global installation is fine.\nFor project that is to be deployed, make sure you use the virtual environment, only then you can ensure what worked for you also works on the deployement\n24f2006531:\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file?\nComing to your second question,\nThe first time you install a fresh dependency, use direct and latest version. But if you are cloning or thinking of sharing the repo or using someone\u2019s project it\u2019s better to use requirements.txt.\n24f2006531:\nMy understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation\nThe creation of requirements.txt ensures that the current installation version is listed.\nNever try to list requirements.txt. There is a command to do that,\npip3 freeze > requirements.txt\n. This does the hard work of listing the dependencies for you",

        "clean_text": "I feel that Week 1 is packed with tutorials from diverse areas. While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don\u2019t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there\u2019s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs  or  mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",

        "clean_text": "# Tools in Data Science - Jan 2025\n\n[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary>\n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\n\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\n\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\n\n- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\n- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\n- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)\n\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\n\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course is quite hard</strong></summary>\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n- Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/45)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t1-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-may-2024-term/127856/60)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t2-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-september-2024-term/144976/62?u=s.anand)\n- Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7)\n- LLMs grade you -- unpredictably.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9)\n- The ROE is hard.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)\n\n**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-01-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Programming skills are a pre-requisite</strong></summary>\n\nYou need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\n\n**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></summary>\n\nYou _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code. Even in projects, assignments, and exams (except the final end-term exam).\n\n**Why should you copy?** Because in real life, there's no time to re-invent the wheel. You'll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It's important to learn how to do that well.\n\n**To learn well, understand** what you're copying. If you're short of time, prioritize.\n\n**To learn better, teach** what you've learnt.\n\n</details>\n\n## We cover 7 modules in 12 weeks\n\nThe content evolves with technology and feedback.\nTrack the [commit history](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/commits/tds-2025-01/) for changes.\n\nReleased content:\n\n1. **[Development Tools](development-tools.md)** and concepts to **build** models and apps.

Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n- \u2021 **Graded Assignments: Best 4 out 7**. We'll take the best 4 out of your graded assignments submissions. These, combined, will have a 15% weightage.\n- **Remote exams are open and hard**\n  - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...\n  - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)\n- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy.\n- **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.\n- **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)\n- **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.\n  - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks.\n\n## Constantly check communications\n\nCheck these three links regularly to keep up with the course.\n\n1. **[Seek Inbox](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)** for Course Announcements.

        "clean_text": "# Tools in Data Science - May 2025\n\n[Tools in Data Science](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/course_pages/BSSE2002.html) is a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course exposes you to real-life tools</strong></summary>\n\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\n\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\n\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\n\n- You learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\n- You learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\n- You learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a `sed` + `grep` script in minutes.\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg) \"We lost the documentation on quantum mechanics. You'll have to decode the regexes yourself.\"](https://explainxkcd.com/224/)\n\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\n\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>This course is quite hard</strong></summary>\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- [2 out of 5 students in the Jan 2025 batch failed](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/when-should-i-take-tools-in-data-science/173268)\n- It _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-based-on-students-opinion/61194)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/difficulty-rating-for-diploma-subjects-2-0-based-on-student-ratings-and-my-experience/85681)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/what-should-i-take-next/44291/6)\n- Now it's hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-course-feedback-t32024-and-course-selection-t12025-thread/160032/45)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t1-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-may-2024-term/127856/60)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/2024-t2-diploma-level-feedback-and-course-selection-for-september-2024-term/144976/62?u=s.anand)\n- Plan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/11)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/4)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/diploma-level-course-combo-suggestion/158460/7)\n- LLMs grade you -- unpredictably.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/concerns-regarding-unfair-grading-practices-for-tds-project-2/160611/10)\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/wrong-marks-in-project-2/160355/9)\n- The ROE is hard.\n  [#](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/is-it-fair-to-consider-20-weightage-of-such-exam-which-is-impossible-to-solve-in-given-time-i-e-roe/141413/10)\n\n**[Take Graded assignment 1](https://exam.sanand.workers.dev/tds-2025-05-ga1) to check if you're ready for this course.** Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>But it's probably worth it.</strong></summary>\n\nHere's students' feedback:\n\n- [Course experience and farewell post](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/course-experience-and-farewell-post/173247)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Programming skills are a pre-requisite</strong></summary>\n\nYou need a _good_ understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Excel, and data science concepts.\n\n**But isn't this a data science course?** Yes. Good data scientists are good programmers. Data scientists don't just analyze data or train models. They source data, clean it, transform it, visualize it, deploy it, and automate the whole process.\n\nIn some organizations, some of this work is done by others (e.g. data engineers, IT teams, etc.). But wherever you are, _some_ of the time, you need to write code for all of this yourself.\n\nThis course teaches you tools that will make you more productive. But you _do_ need programming to learn many of them.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>If you passed, don't enroll again</strong></summary>\n\nThe course is public, so you can always audit it.\n\nAlso, registering again for the course [does not improve marks much](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/why-you-should-almost-never-register-for-tds-improvement-if-you-have-passed-it/173625).\n\n</details>\n\n<summary><strong>We encourage learning by sharing</strong></summary>\n\nYou _CAN_ copy from friends. You can work in groups. You can share code.

Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It'll be too tough for you now.\n- **Remote exams are open and hard**\n  - You can use the Internet, WhatsApp, ChatGPT, your notes, your friends, your pets...\n  - The RoE is especially hard. Read: [What is the purpose of an impossible RoE exam?](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/whats-the-actual-purpose-of-impossible-roe-exam/99838/2)\n- **Final exam is in-person and closed book**. It tests your memory. It's easy.\n- **Projects test application**. The projects test how well you apply what you learnt in a real-world context.\n- **Bonus activities may be posted on Discourse**. See [previous bonus activities](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/tags/c/courses/tds-kb/34/bonus-marks)\n- **Evaluations are mostly automated**. This course uses pre-computed (for objective) or LLMs (for subjective) evaluations.\n  - LLMs will evaluate you differently each time. Learn to prompt them _robustly_ to get higher marks.\n\n## Constantly check communications\n\nCheck these three links regularly to keep up with the course.\n\n1. **[Seek Notifications](https://seek.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/)** for Course Notifications.

And to get the\ndata set, you need to know where it is. This is what we will be covering in the first module.\n\nHow do you discover data? There are three things that you will learn in this module.\n\n- The first is, what are the different sources of data sets? Where can you find them?\n- The second is, what are the different kinds of data sets? Structured, unstructured and semi-structured.\n- Third, in each data set, what are the different kinds of values that you will find?\n\nThis will give you a sense of locating the kind of data set that you want, either on the internet\nor within your organization or even within your phones.\n\n## Sources of Data\n\n[![Sources of Data](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GY5l_5RpVZM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GY5l_5RpVZM)\n\n- [Awesome public datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets)\n- [Google dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/)\n- [Kaggle datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/)\n- [Data.gov](https://data.gov/) and [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)\n- [Datameet](https://datameet.org/)\n\n## Types of datasets\n\n[![Types of datasets](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/u8PIxqsi1kk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/u8PIxqsi1kk)\n\n- Structured data has a schema: Databases, Spreadsheets, Forms, Shapefiles\n- Semi-structured data has a flexible schema: JSON, HTML, Email\n- Unstructured data has no schema: Text, Images, Audio, Video\n- [DBF opener](https://www.dbfopener.com/)\n- [MapShaper lets you view Shapefiles](https://mapshaper.org/)\n\n## Types of values\n\n[![Types of values](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HlsqT0r9wAM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/HlsqT0r9wAM)\n\n- Categorical values may be:\n  - Boolean: True or False\n  - Unordered: No order, like colors\n  - Ordered: Order, like ratings\n  - Cyclical: Like days of the week\n  - Unstructured: Like names, images\n- Numerical values may be:\n  - Integer: You can add or subtract\n  - Real: You can multiply or divide\n- Composite values have an internal structure\n  - Temporal: Date, Time\n  - Spatial: Latitude, Longitude, Shapefiles\n  - Structured: JSON, XML with schema\n  - Specialized: IP addresses, URLs, Email addresses, Phone numbers, etc.\n\n## Week Summary\n\n[![Discover the Data - Summary](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/NNiFxgANu8Y/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/NNiFxgANu8Y)\n\nBased on what you have learnt in this module, you should be able to do two things: find data and understand what type of data it is.\n\nBoth of these are powerful skills.\n\nThe more data you are able to find, the more analysis that you will be able to do that others are unable to.\nTherefore, discovering new sources of data is a competitive advantage and a skill that is well worth building.\n\nThe other, in terms of understanding the type of data, will give you an edge in terms of knowing which data set is easier to work with.\nStructured data is easier to work with because you don't have to do any additional work.\nYou don't have to extract information from it.\nNumerical values are easier to work with than, let's say, categorical or composite because there's less effot to extract the structure.\nSo you'll be able to compare two data sets and say that one gets more results by spending in less time and effort.\n\n## Sample questions\n\n- Find the UCI machine learning dataset on Wine Quality. (It has 4,898 rows.) What is the highest pH value of the red wines? (ANS: 4.01)\n- What's the official data portal of Russia? (ANS: <https://data.gov.ru/?language=en>)\n- Are research papers structured, semi-structured or unstructured? (ANS: Semi-structured.

        "clean_text": "# Base 64 Encoding\n\nBase64 is a method to convert binary data into ASCII text. It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\n\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\n\n[![What is Base64? (3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n- ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n- There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n- Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode()        # Hello, World!\n# Convert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n\n# Working with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\n    binary_data = f.read()\n    image_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\n\n# Data URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\n```\n\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS. This reduces the number of HTTP requests and also works offline. But it increases the file size.\n\nFor example, here's an SVG image embedded as a data URI:\n\n```html\n<img\n  src=\"data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiI+PGNpcmNsZSBjeD0iMTYiIGN5PSIxNiIgcj0iMTUiIGZpbGw9IiMyNTYzZWIiLz48cGF0aCBmaWxsPSIjZmZmIiBkPSJtMTYgNyAyIDcgNyAyLTcgMi0yIDctMi03LTctMiA3LTJaIi8+PC9zdmc+\"\n/>\n```\n\nBase64 is used in many places:\n\n- JSON: Encoding binary data in JSON payloads\n- Email: MIME attachments encoding\n- Auth: HTTP Basic Authentication headers\n- JWT: Encoding tokens in web authentication\n- SSL/TLS: PEM certificate format\n- SAML: Encoding assertions in SSO\n- Git: Encoding binary files in patches\n\nTools for working with Base64:\n\n- [Base64 Decoder/Encoder](https://www.base64decode.org/) for online encoding/decoding\n- [data: URI Generator](https://dopiaza.org/tools/datauri/index.php) converts files to Data URIs",

        "clean_text": "## Converting HTML to Markdown\n\nWhen working with web content, converting HTML files to plain text or Markdown is a common requirement for content extraction, analysis, and preservation. For example:\n\n- **Content analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\n- **Data mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\n- **Offline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\n- **Content migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms\n- **SEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\n- **Archive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\n- **Accessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\n\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line.\n\n### defuddle-cli\n\n[defuddle-cli](https://github.com/defuddle/defuddle) specializes in HTML - Markdown conversion. It's a bit slow and not very customizable but produces clean Markdown that preserves structure, links, and basic formatting. Best for content where preserving the document structure is important.\n\n```bash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec npx --package defuddle-cli -y defuddle parse {} --md -o {}.md \\;\n```\n\n- `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n- `npx --package defuddle-cli -y`: Installs and runs defuddle-cli without prompting\n- `defuddle parse {} --md`: Parses the HTML file (represented by `{}`) and converts to markdown\n- `-o {}.md`: Outputs to a file with the original name plus .md extension\n\n### Pandoc\n\n[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) is a bit slow and highly customizable, preserving almost all formatting elements, leading to verbose markdown. Best for academic or documentation conversion where precision matters.\n\nPandoc can convert from many other formats (such as Word, PDF, LaTeX, etc.) to Markdown and vice versa, making it one of most popular and versatele document convertors.\n\n[![How to Convert a Word Document to Markdown for Free using Pandoc (12 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HPSK7q13-40/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/HPSK7q13-40)\n\n```bash\nfind . -name '*.html' -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {} \\;\n```\n\n- `find . -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec ... \\;`: Executes the following command for each file found\n- `pandoc`: The Swiss Army knife of document conversion\n- `-f html -t markdown_strict`: Convert from HTML format to strict markdown\n- `-o {}.md {}`: Output to a markdown file, with the input file as the last argument\n\n### Lynx\n\n[Lynx](https://lynx.invisible-island.net/) is fast and generates text (not Markdown) with minimal formatting. Lynx renders the HTML as it would appear in a text browser, preserving basic structure but losing complex formatting. Best for quick content extraction or when processing large numbers of files.\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' -exec sh -c 'for f; do lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.txt\"; done' _ {} +\n```\n\n- `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n- `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n- `lynx -dump -nolist \"$f\"`: Uses the lynx text browser to render HTML as plain text\n  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  - `-nolist`: Don't include the list of links at the end\n- `> \"${f%.html}.txt\"`: Save output to a .txt file with the same base name\n\n### w3m\n\n[w3m](https://w3m.sourceforge.net/) is very slow processing with minimal formatting. w3m tends to be more thorough in its rendering than lynx but takes considerably longer. It supports basic JavaScript processing, making it better at handling modern websites with dynamic content. Best for cases where you need slightly better rendering than lynx, particularly for complex layouts and tables, and when some JavaScript processing is beneficial.\n\n```bash\nfind . -type f -name '*.html' \\\n  -exec sh -c 'for f; do \\\n      w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\" > \"${f%.html}.md\"; \\\n    done' _ {} +\n```\n\n- `find . -type f -name '*.html'`: Finds all HTML files in the current directory and subdirectories\n- `-exec sh -c '...' _ {} +`: Executes a shell command with batched files for efficiency\n- `for f; do ... done`: Loops through each file in the batch\n- `w3m -dump -T text/html -cols 80 -no-graph \"$f\"`: Uses the w3m text browser to render HTML\n  - `-dump`: Output the rendered page to stdout\n  - `-T text/html`: Specify input format as HTML\n  - `-cols 80`: Set output width to 80 columns\n  - `-no-graph`: Don't show graphic characters for tables and frames\n- `> \"${f%.html}.md\"`: Save output to a .md file with the same base name\n\n### Comparison\n\n| Approach     | Speed     | Format Quality | Preservation                       | Best For                        |\n| ------------ | --------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |\n| defuddle-cli | Slow      | High           | Good structure and links           | Content migration, publishing   |\n| pandoc       | Slow      | Very High      | Almost everything                  | Academic papers, documentation  |\n| lynx         | Fast      | Low            | Basic structure only               | Quick extraction, large batches |\n| w3m          | Very Slow | Medium-Low     | Basic structure with better tables | Improved readability over lynx  |\n\n### Optimize Batch Processing\n\n1. **Process in parallel**: Use GNU Parallel for multi-core processing:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" | parallel \"pandoc -f html -t markdown_strict -o {}.md {}\"\n   ```\n\n2. **Filter files before processing**:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -type f -size -1M -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown {} -o {}.md \\;\n   ```\n\n3. **Customize output format** with additional parameters:\n\n   ```bash\n   # For pandoc, preserve line breaks but simplify other formatting\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec pandoc -f html -t markdown --wrap=preserve --atx-headers {} -o {}.md \\;\n   ```\n\n4. **Handle errors gracefully**:\n\n   ```bash\n   find . -name \"*.html\" -exec sh -c 'for f; do pandoc -f html -t markdown \"$f\" -o \"${f%.html}.md\" 2>/dev/null || echo \"Failed: $f\" >> conversion_errors.log; done' _ {} +\n   ```\n\n### Choosing the Right Tool\n\n- **Need speed with minimal formatting?** Use the lynx approach\n- **Need precise, complete conversion?** Use pandoc\n- **Need a balance of structure and cleanliness?** Try defuddle-cli\n- **Working with complex tables?** w3m might render them better\n\nRemember that the best approach depends on your specific use case, volume of files, and how you intend to use the converted text.\n\n### Combined Crawling and Conversion\n\nSometimes you need to both crawl a website and convert its content to markdown or text in a single workflow, like [Crawl4AI](#crawl4ai) or [markdown-crawler](#markdown-crawler).\n\n1. **For research/data collection**: Use a specialized crawler (like Crawl4AI) with post-processing conversion\n2. **For simple website archiving**: Markdown-crawler provides a convenient all-in-one solution\n3. **For high-quality conversion**: Use wget/wget2 for crawling followed by pandoc for conversion\n4. **For maximum speed**: Combine wget with lynx in a pipeline\n\n### Crawl4AI\n\n[Crawl4AI](https://github.com/crawl4ai/crawl4ai) is designed for single-page extraction with high-quality content processing. Crawl4AI is optimized for AI training data extraction, focusing on clean, structured content rather than complete site preservation. It excels at removing boilerplate content and preserving the main article text.\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install crawl4ai\ncrawl4ai-setup\n```\n\n- `uv venv`: Creates a Python virtual environment using uv (a faster alternative to virtualenv)\n- `source .venv/bin/activate.fish`: Activates the virtual environment (fish shell syntax)\n- `uv pip install crawl4ai`: Installs the crawl4ai package\n- `crawl4ai-setup`: Initializes crawl4ai's required dependencies\n\n### markdown-crawler\n\n[markdown-crawler](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-crawler/) combines web crawling with markdown conversion in one tool. It's efficient for bulk processing but tends to produce lower-quality markdown conversion compared to specialized converters like pandoc or defuddle. Best for projects where quantity and integration are more important than perfect formatting.\n\n```bash\nuv venv\nsource .venv/bin/activate.fish\nuv pip install markdown-crawler\nmarkdown-crawler -t 5 -d 3 -b ./markdown https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\n- `uv venv` and activation: Same as above\n- `uv pip install markdown-crawler`: Installs the markdown-crawler package\n- `markdown-crawler`: Runs the crawler with these options:\n  - `-t 5`: Sets 5 threads for parallel crawling\n  - `-d 3`: Limits crawl depth to 3 levels\n  - `-b ./markdown`: Sets the base output directory\n  - Final argument is the starting URL",

        "clean_text": "## Converting PDFs to Markdown\n\nPDF documents are ubiquitous in academic, business, and technical contexts, but extracting and repurposing their content can be challenging. This tutorial explores various command-line tools for converting PDFs to Markdown format, with a focus on preserving structure and formatting suitable for different use cases, including preparation for Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nUse Cases:\n\n- **LLM training and fine-tuning**: Create clean text data from PDFs for AI model training\n- **Knowledge base creation**: Transform PDFs into searchable, editable markdown documents\n- **Content repurposing**: Convert academic papers and reports for web publication\n- **Data extraction**: Pull structured content from PDF documents for analysis\n- **Accessibility**: Convert PDFs to more accessible formats for screen readers\n- **Citation and reference management**: Extract bibliographic information from academic papers\n- **Documentation conversion**: Transform technical PDFs into maintainable documentation\n\n### PyMuPDF4LLM\n\n[PyMuPDF4LLM](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pymupdf4llm/) is a specialized component of the PyMuPDF library that generates Markdown specifically formatted for Large Language Models. It produces high-quality markdown with good preservation of document structure. It's specifically optimized for producing text that works well with LLMs, removing irrelevant formatting while preserving semantic structure. Requires PyTorch, which adds dependencies but enables more advanced processing capabilities.\n\nPyMuPDF4LLM uses [MuPDF](https://mupdf.com/) as its PDF parsing engine. [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) is emerging as a strong default for PDF text extraction due to its accuracy and performance in handling complex PDF structures.\n\n```bash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uv run --with pymupdf4llm python -c 'import pymupdf4llm; h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\"); h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))'\n```\n\n- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding regardless of system locale\n- `uv run --with pymupdf4llm`: Uses uv package manager to run Python with the pymupdf4llm package\n- `python -c '...'`: Executes Python code directly from the command line\n- `import pymupdf4llm`: Imports the PDF-to-Markdown module\n- `h = open(\"pymupdf4llm.md\", \"w\")`: Creates a file to write the markdown output\n- `h.write(pymupdf4llm.to_markdown(\"$FILE.pdf\"))`: Converts the PDF to markdown and writes to file\n\n## Markitdown\n\n[![Microsoft MarkItDown - Convert Files and Office Documents to Markdown - Install Locally (9 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v65Oyddfxeg/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/v65Oyddfxeg)\n\n[Markitdown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) is Microsoft's tool for converting various document formats to Markdown, including PDFs, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, and ZIP files. It's a versatile multi-format converter that handles PDFs via PDFMiner, DOCX via Mammoth, XLSX via Pandas, and PPTX via Python-PPTX. Good for batch processing of mixed document types. The quality of PDF conversion is generally good but may struggle with complex layouts or heavily formatted documents.\n\n```bash\nPYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown $FILE.pdf > markitdown.md\n```\n\n- `PYTHONUTF8=1`: Forces Python to use UTF-8 encoding\n- `uvx markitdown`: Runs the markitdown tool via the uv package manager\n- `$FILE.pdf`: The input PDF file\n- `> markitdown.md`: Redirects output to a markdown file\n\n### Unstructured\n\n[Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/) is rapidly becoming the de facto library for parsing over 40 different file types. It is excellent for extracting text and tables from diverse document formats. Particularly useful for generating clean content to pass to LLMs. Strong community support and actively maintained.\n\n## GROBID\n\nIf you specifically need to parse references from text-native PDFs or reliably OCR'ed ones, [GROBID](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) remains the de facto choice. It excels at extracting structured bibliographic information with high accuracy.\n\n```bash\n# Start GROBID service\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.7.2\n\n# Process PDF with curl\ncurl -X POST -F \"input=@paper.pdf\" localhost:8070/api/processFulltextDocument > references.tei.xml\n```\n\n### Mistral OCR API\n\n[Mistral OCR](https://mistral.ai/products/ocr/) offers an end-to-end cloud API that preserves both text and layout, making it easier to isolate specific sections like References. It shows the most promise currently, though it requires post-processing.\n\n## Azure Document Intelligence API\n\nFor enterprise users already in the Microsoft ecosystem, [Azure Document Intelligence](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/document-intelligence) provides excellent raw OCR with enterprise SLAs. May require custom model training or post-processing to match GROBID's reference extraction capabilities.\n\n### Other libraries\n\n[Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is IBM's document understanding library that supports PDF conversion. It can be challenging to install, particularly on Windows and some Linux distributions. Offers advanced document understanding capabilities beyond simple text extraction.\n\n[MegaParse](https://github.com/QuivrHQ/MegaParse) takes a comprehensive approach using LibreOffice, Pandoc, Tesseract OCR, and other tools. It has Robust handling of different document types but requires an OpenAI API key for some features. Good for complex documents but has significant dependencies.\n\n## Comparison of PDF-to-Markdown Tools\n\n| Tool         | Strengths                                | Weaknesses                   | Best For                             |\n| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |\n| PyMuPDF4LLM  | Structure preservation, LLM optimization | Requires PyTorch             | AI training data, semantic structure |\n| Markitdown   | Multi-format support, simple usage       | Less precise layout handling | Batch processing, mixed documents    |\n| Unstructured | Wide format support, active development  | Can be resource-intensive    | Production pipelines, integration    |\n| GROBID       | Reference extraction excellence          | Narrower use case            | Academic papers, citations           |\n| Docling      | Advanced document understanding          | Installation difficulties    | Research applications                |\n| MegaParse    | Comprehensive approach                   | Requires OpenAI API          | Complex documents, OCR needs         |\n\nHow to pick:\n\n- **Need LLM-ready content?** PyMuPDF4LLM is specifically designed for this\n- **Working with multiple document formats?** Markitdown handles diverse inputs\n- **Extracting academic references?** GROBID remains the standard\n- **Building a production pipeline?** Unstructured offers the best integration options\n- **Handling complex layouts?** Consider commercial OCR like Mistral or Azure Document Intelligence\n\nThe optimal approach depends on your specific requirements regarding accuracy, structure preservation, and the intended use of the extracted content.\n\n## Tips for Optimal PDF Conversion\n\n1. **Pre-process PDFs** when possible:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Optimize a PDF for text extraction first\n   ocrmypdf --optimize 3 --skip-text input.pdf optimized.pdf\n   ```\n\n2. **Try multiple tools** on the same document to compare results:\n\n3. **Handle scanned PDFs** appropriately:\n\n   ```bash\n   # For scanned documents, run OCR first\n   ocrmypdf --force-ocr input.pdf ocr_ready.pdf\n   PYTHONUTF8=1 uvx markitdown ocr_ready.pdf > markitdown.md\n   ```\n\n4. **Consider post-processing** for better results:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Simple post-processing example\n   sed -i 's/\\([A-Z]\\)\\./\\1\\.\\n/g' output.md  # Add line breaks after sentences\n   ```",

        "clean_text": "## CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing\n\nCORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism that controls how web browsers handle requests between different origins (domains, protocols, or ports). Data scientists need CORS for APIs serving data or analysis to a browser on a different domain.\n\nWatch this practical explanation of CORS (3 min):\n\n[![CORS in 100 Seconds](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/4KHiSt0oLJ0/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/4KHiSt0oLJ0)\n\nKey CORS concepts:\n\n- **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers block requests between different origins by default\n- **CORS Headers**: Server responses must include specific headers to allow cross-origin requests\n- **Preflight Requests**: Browsers send OPTIONS requests to check if the actual request is allowed\n- **Credentials**: Special handling required for requests with cookies or authentication\n\nIf you're exposing your API with a GET request publicly, the only thing you need to do is set the HTTP header `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`.\n\nHere are other common CORS headers:\n\n```http\nAccess-Control-Allow-Origin: https://example.com\nAccess-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE\nAccess-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization\nAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials: true\n```\n\nTo implement CORS in FastAPI, use the [`CORSMiddleware` middleware](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/):\n\n```python\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\nfrom fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\napp.add_middleware(CORSMiddleware, allow_origins=[\"*\"]) # Allow GET requests from all origins\n# Or, provide more granular control:\napp.add_middleware(\n    CORSMiddleware,\n    allow_origins=[\"https://example.com\"],  # Allow a specific domain\n    allow_credentials=True,  # Allow cookies\n    allow_methods=[\"GET\", \"POST\", \"PUT\", \"DELETE\"],  # Allow specific methods\n    allow_headers=[\"*\"],  # Allow all headers\n)\n```\n\nTesting CORS with JavaScript:\n\n```javascript\n// Simple request\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  method: \"GET\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n\n// Request with credentials\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\", {\n  credentials: \"include\",\n  headers: { \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" },\n});\n```\n\nUseful CORS debugging tools:\n\n- [CORS Checker](https://cors-test.codehappy.dev/): Test CORS configurations\n- Browser DevTools Network tab: Inspect CORS headers and preflight requests\n- [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere): CORS proxy for development\n\nCommon CORS errors and solutions:\n\n- `No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header`: Configure server to send proper CORS headers\n- `Request header field not allowed`: Add required headers to `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`\n- `Credentials flag`: Set both `credentials: 'include'` and `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`\n- `Wild card error`: Cannot use `*` with credentials; specify exact origins",

        "clean_text": "## Crawling with the CLI\n\nSince websites are a common source of data, we often download entire websites (crawling) and then process them offline.\n\nWeb crawling is essential in many data-driven scenarios:\n\n- **Data mining and analysis**: Gathering structured data from multiple pages for market research, competitive analysis, or academic research\n- **Content archiving**: Creating offline copies of websites for preservation or backup purposes\n- **SEO analysis**: Analyzing site structure, metadata, and content to improve search rankings\n- **Legal compliance**: Capturing website content for regulatory or compliance documentation\n- **Website migration**: Creating a complete copy before moving to a new platform or design\n- **Offline access**: Downloading educational resources, documentation, or reference materials for use without internet connection\n\nThe most commonly used tool for fetching websites is [`wget`](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). It is pre-installed in many UNIX distributions and easy to install.\n\n[![Scraping Websites using Wget (8 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pLfH5TZBGXo/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/pLfH5TZBGXo)\n\nTo crawl the [IIT Madras Data Science Program website](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/) for example, you could run:\n\n```bash\nwget \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\nHere's what each option does:\n\n- `--recursive`: Enables recursive downloading (following links)\n- `--level=3`: Limits recursion depth to 3 levels from the initial URL\n- `--no-parent`: Restricts crawling to only URLs below the initial directory\n- `--convert-links`: Converts all links in downloaded documents to work locally\n- `--adjust-extension`: Adds proper extensions to files (.html, .jpg, etc.) based on MIME types\n- `--compression=auto`: Automatically handles compressed content (gzip, deflate)\n- `--accept html,htm`: Only downloads files with these extensions\n- `--directory-prefix=./ds`: Saves all downloaded files to the specified directory\n\n[wget2](https://gitlab.com/gnuwget/wget2) is a better version of `wget` and supports HTTP2, parallel connections, and only updates modified sites. The syntax is (mostly) the same.\n\n```bash\nwget2 \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\nThere are popular free and open-source alternatives to Wget:\n\n### Wpull\n\n[Wpull](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/wpull) is a wget\u2010compatible Python crawler that supports on-disk resumption, WARC output, and PhantomJS integration.\n\n```bash\nuvx wpull \\\n  --recursive \\\n  --level=3 \\\n  --no-parent \\\n  --convert-links \\\n  --adjust-extension \\\n  --compression=auto \\\n  --accept html,htm \\\n  --directory-prefix=./ds \\\n  https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\n```\n\n### HTTrack\n\n[HTTrack](https://www.httrack.com/html/fcguide.html) is dedicated website\u2010mirroring tool with rich filtering and link\u2010conversion options.\n\n```bash\nhttrack \"https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/\" \\\n  -O \"./ds\" \\\n  \"+*.study.iitm.ac.in/ds/*\" \\\n  -r3\n```\n\n### Robots.txt\n\n`robots.txt` is a standard file found in a website's root directory that specifies which parts of the site should not be accessed by web crawlers. It's part of the Robots Exclusion Protocol, an ethical standard for web crawling.\n\n**Why it's important**:\n\n- **Server load protection**: Prevents excessive traffic that could overload servers\n- **Privacy protection**: Keeps sensitive or private content from being indexed\n- **Legal compliance**: Respects website owners' rights to control access to their content\n- **Ethical web citizenship**: Shows respect for website administrators' wishes\n\n**How to override robots.txt restrictions**:\n\n- **wget, wget2**: Use `-e robots=off`\n- **httrack**: Use `-s0`\n- **wpull**: Use `--no-robots`\n\n**When to override robots.txt (use with discretion)**:\n\nOnly bypass `robots.txt` when:\n\n- You have explicit permission from the website owner\n- You're crawling your own website\n- The content is publicly accessible and your crawling won't cause server issues\n- You're conducting authorized security testing\n\nRemember that bypassing `robots.txt` without legitimate reason may:\n\n- Violate terms of service\n- Lead to IP banning\n- Result in legal consequences in some jurisdictions\n- Cause reputation damage to your organization\n\nAlways use the minimum necessary crawling speed and scope, and consider contacting website administrators for permission when in doubt.",

The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way\u2014you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\n\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\n\n[![Data Sourcing - Introduction](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/1LyblMkJzOo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/1LyblMkJzOo)\n\nHere are links used in the video:\n\n- [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset)\n- [IMDb Datasets](https://imdb.com/interfaces/)\n- [Download the IMDb Datasets](https://datasets.imdbws.com/)\n- [Explore the Internet Movie Database](https://gramener.com/imdb/)\n- [What does the world search for?](https://gramener.com/search/)\n- [HowStat - Cricket statistics](https://howstat.com/cricket/home.asp)\n- [Cricket Strike Rates](https://gramener.com/cricket/)",

Podman is compatible with Docker and has better security (and a slightly more open license). In this course, we recommend Podman but Docker works in the same way.\n\nInitialize the container engine:\n\n```bash\npodman machine init\npodman machine start\n```\n\nCommon Operations. (You can use `docker` instead of `podman` in the same way.)\n\n```bash\n# Pull an image\npodman pull python:3.11-slim\n\n# Run a container\npodman run -it python:3.11-slim\n\n# List containers\npodman ps -a\n\n# Stop container\npodman stop container_id\n\n# Scan image for vulnerabilities\npodman scan myapp:latest\n\n# Remove container\npodman rm container_id\n\n# Remove all stopped containers\npodman container prune\n```\n\nYou can create a `Dockerfile` to build a container image. Here's a sample `Dockerfile` that converts a Python script into a container image.\n\n```dockerfile\nFROM python:3.11-slim\n# Set working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n# Typically, you would use `COPY . .` to copy files from the host machine,\n# but here we're just using a simple script.\nRUN echo 'print(\"Hello, world!\")' > app.py\n# Run the script\nCMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]\n```\n\nTo build, run, and deploy the container, run these commands:\n\n```bash\n# Create an account on https://hub.docker.com/ and then login\npodman login docker.io\n\n# Build and run the container\npodman build -t py-hello .\npodman run -it py-hello\n\n# Push the container to Docker Hub. Replace $DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME with your Docker Hub username.\npodman push py-hello:latest docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello\n\n# Push adding a specific tag, e.g. dev\nTAG=dev podman push py-hello docker.io/$DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME/py-hello:$TAG\n```\n\nTools:\n\n- [Dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive): Explore image layers\n- [Skopeo](https://github.com/containers/skopeo): Work with container images\n- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Security scanner\n\n[![Podman Tutorial Zero to Hero | Full 1 Hour Course](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/YXfA5O5Mr18/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/YXfA5O5Mr18)\n\n[![Learn Docker in 7 Easy Steps - Full Beginner's Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/gAkwW2tuIqE/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/gAkwW2tuIqE)\n\n- Optional: For Windows, see [WSL 2 with Docker getting started](https://youtu.be/5RQbdMn04Oc)",

        "clean_text": "## Embeddings: OpenAI and Local Models\n\nEmbedding models convert text into a list of numbers. These are like a map of text in numerical form. Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\n\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n\n1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories.\n3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters.\n4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.\n\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n\n| Feature     | Local Models               | API                       |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| **Privacy** | High                       | Dependent on provider     |\n| **Cost**    | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go             |\n| **Scale**   | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| **Quality** | Varies by model            | Typically high            |\n\nThe [Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n\n1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input.\n5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\n\n### Local Embeddings\n\n[![Guide to Local Embeddings with Sentence Transformers](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OATCgQtNX2o/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/OATCgQtNX2o)\n\nHere's a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \"==3.12\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"sentence-transformers\",\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"numpy\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nfrom sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer\nimport numpy as np\n\nmodel = SentenceTransformer('BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5')  # A small, high quality model\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using local model.\"\"\"\n    return model.encode(text).tolist()\n\nasync def get_similarity(text1: str, text2: str) -> float:\n    \"\"\"Calculate cosine similarity between two texts.\"\"\"\n    emb1 = np.array(await embed(text1))\n    emb2 = np.array(await embed(text2))\n    return float(np.dot(emb1, emb2) / (np.linalg.norm(emb1) * np.linalg.norm(emb2)))\n\nasync def main():\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Orange\"))\n    print(await get_similarity(\"Apple\", \"Lightning\"))\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import asyncio\n    asyncio.run(main())\n```\n\nNote the `get_similarity` function. It uses a [Cosine Similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) to calculate the similarity between two embeddings.\n\n### OpenAI Embeddings\n\nFor comparison, here's how to use OpenAI's API with direct HTTP calls. Replace the `embed` function in the earlier script:\n\n```python\nimport os\nimport httpx\n\nasync def embed(text: str) -> list[float]:\n    \"\"\"Get embedding vector for text using OpenAI's API.\"\"\"\n    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n        response = await client.post(\n            \"https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings\",\n            headers={\"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY']}\"},\n            json={\"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": text}\n        )\n        return response.json()[\"data\"][0][\"embedding\"]\n```\n\n**NOTE**: You need to set the [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable for this to work.",

Use `-c copy` when possible to avoid re-encoding\n2. Monitor progress with `-progress pipe:1`\n3. Use `-hide_banner` to reduce output verbosity\n4. Test commands with small clips first\n5. Use hardware acceleration when available (-hwaccel auto)\n\nError Handling:\n\n```bash\n# Validate file before processing\nffprobe input.mp4 2>&1 | grep \"Invalid\"\n\n# Continue on errors in batch processing\nffmpeg -i input.mp4 output.mp4 -xerror\n\n# Get detailed error information\nffmpeg -v error -i input.mp4 2>&1 | grep -A2 \"Error\"\n```\n\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format {video}` -->\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `ffmpeg -i {video} -vf \"select='eq(n,0)'\" -vframes 1 {email}.jpg` -->\n\n## Media tools: yt-dlp\n\n[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) is a feature-rich command-line tool for downloading audio/video from thousands of sites. It's particularly useful for extracting audio and transcripts from videos.\n\nInstall using your package manager:\n\n```bash\n# macOS\nbrew install yt-dlp\n\n# Linux\ncurl -L https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp -o ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp\nchmod a+rx ~/.local/bin/yt-dlp\n\n# Windows\nwinget install yt-dlp\n```\n\nCommon operations for extracting audio and transcripts:\n\n```bash\n# Download audio only at lowest quality suitable for speech\nyt-dlp -f \"ba[abr<50]/worstaudio\" \\\n       --extract-audio \\\n       --audio-format mp3 \\\n       --audio-quality 32k \\\n       \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\"\n\n# Download auto-generated subtitles\nyt-dlp --write-auto-sub \\\n       --skip-download \\\n       --sub-format \"srt\" \\\n       \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\"\n\n# Download both audio and subtitles with custom output template\nyt-dlp -f \"ba[abr<50]/worstaudio\" \\\n       --extract-audio \\\n       --audio-format mp3 \\\n       --audio-quality 32k \\\n       --write-auto-sub \\\n       --sub-format \"srt\" \\\n       -o \"%(title)s.%(ext)s\" \\\n       \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\"\n\n# Download entire playlist's audio\nyt-dlp -f \"ba[abr<50]/worstaudio\" \\\n       --extract-audio \\\n       --audio-format mp3 \\\n       --audio-quality 32k \\\n       -o \"%(playlist_index)s-%(title)s.%(ext)s\" \\\n       \"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAYLIST_ID\"\n```\n\nFor Python integration:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.9\"\n# dependencies = [\"yt-dlp\"]\n# ///\n\nimport yt_dlp\n\ndef download_audio(url: str) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Download audio at speech-optimized quality.\"\"\"\n    ydl_opts = {\n        'format': 'ba[abr<50]/worstaudio',\n        'postprocessors': [{\n            'key': 'FFmpegExtractAudio',\n            'preferredcodec': 'mp3',\n            'preferredquality': '32'\n        }]\n    }\n\n    with yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ydl_opts) as ydl:\n        ydl.download([url])\n\n# Example usage\ndownload_audio('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID')\n```\n\nTools:\n\n- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/): Required for audio extraction and conversion\n- [whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper): Can be used with yt-dlp for speech-to-text\n- [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl): Alternative for image-focused sites\n\nNote: Always respect copyright and terms of service when downloading content.\n\n## Whisper transcription\n\n[Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) is a highly optimized implementation of OpenAI's [Whisper model](https://github.com/openai/whisper), offering up to 4x faster transcription while using less memory.\n\nYou can install it via:\n\n- `pip install faster-whisper`\n- [Download Windows Standalone](https://github.com/Purfview/whisper-standalone-win/releases)\n\nHere's a basic usage example:\n\n```bash\nfaster-whisper-xxl \"video.mp4\" --model medium --language en\n```\n\nHere's my recommendation for transcribing videos. This saves the output in JSON as well as SRT format in the source directory.\n\n```bash\nfaster-whisper-xxl --print_progress --output_dir source --batch_recursive \\\n                   --check_files --standard --output_format json srt \\\n                   --model medium --language en $FILE\n```\n\n- `--model`: The OpenAI Whisper model to use. You can choose from:\n  - `tiny`: Fastest but least accurate\n  - `base`: Good for simple audio\n  - `small`: Balanced speed/accuracy\n  - `medium`: Recommended default\n  - `large-v3`: Most accurate but slowest\n- `--output_format`: The output format to use. You can pick multiple formats from:\n  - `json`: Has the most detailed information including timing, text, quality, etc.\n  - `srt`: A popular subtitle format. You can use this in YouTube, for example.\n  - `vtt`: A modern subtitle format.\n  - `txt`: Just the text transcript\n- `--output_dir`: The directory to save the output files. `source` indicates the source directory, i.e. where the input `$FILE` is\n- `--language`: The language of the input file. If you don't specify it, it analyzes the first 30 seconds to auto-detect. You can speed it up by specifying it.\n\nRun `faster-whisper-xxl --help` for more options.\n\n## Gemini transcription\n\nThe [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) models from Google are notable in two ways:\n\n1. They have a _huge_ input context window. Gemini 2.0 Flash can accept 1M tokens, for example.\n2. They can handle audio input.\n\nThis allows us to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\nLLMs are not good at transcribing audio _faithfully_. They tend to correct errors and meander from what was said. But they are intelligent. That enables a few powerful workflows. Here are some examples:\n\n1. **Transcribe into other languages**. Gemini will handle the transcription and translation in a single step.\n2. **Summarize audio transcripts**. For example, convert a podcast into a tutorial, or a meeting recording into actions.\n3. **Legal Proceeding Analysis**. Extract case citations, dates, and other details from a legal debate.\n4. **Medical Consultation Summary**. Extract treatments, medications, details of next visit, etc. from a medical consultation.\n\nHere's how to use Gemini to transcribe audio files.\n\n1. Get a [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) from Google AI Studio.\n2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable to the API key.\n3. Set the `MP3_FILE` environment variable to the path of the MP3 file you want to transcribe.\n4. Run this code:\n   ```bash\n   curl -X POST https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash-002:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse \\\n     -H \"X-Goog-API-Key: $GEMINI_API_KEY\" \\\n     -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n     -d \"$(cat << EOF\n   {\n     \"contents\": [\n       {\n         \"role\": \"user\",\n         \"parts\": [\n           {\n             \"inline_data\": {\n               \"mime_type\": \"audio/mp3\",\n               \"data\": \"$(base64 --wrap=0 $MP3_FILE)\"\n             }\n           },\n           {\"text\": \"Transcribe this\"}\n         ]\n       }\n     ]\n   }\n   EOF\n   )\"\n   ```",

Full Beginner Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/aqdWSYWC_LI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/aqdWSYWC_LI)\n\nHere's a minimal example using Python and OpenAI's function calling that identifies the weather in a given location.\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"httpx\",\n# ]\n# ///\n\nimport httpx\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict, Any\n\n\ndef query_gpt(user_input: str, tools: list[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    response = httpx.post(\n        \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\",\n        headers={\n            \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')}\",\n            \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n        },\n        json={\n            \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n            \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}],\n            \"tools\": tools,\n            \"tool_choice\": \"auto\",\n        },\n    )\n    return response.json()[\"choices\"][0][\"message\"]\n\n\nWEATHER_TOOL = {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"get_weather\",\n        \"description\": \"Get the current weather for a location\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"location\": {\"type\": \"string\", \"description\": \"City name or coordinates\"}\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"location\"],\n            \"additionalProperties\": False,\n        },\n        \"strict\": True,\n    },\n}\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    response = query_gpt(\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\", [WEATHER_TOOL])\n    print([tool_call[\"function\"] for tool_call in response[\"tool_calls\"]])\n```\n\n### How to define functions\n\nThe function definition is a [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) with a few OpenAI specific properties.\nSee the [Supported schemas](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs#supported-schemas).\n\nHere's an example of a function definition for scheduling a meeting:\n\n```python\nMEETING_TOOL = {\n    \"type\": \"function\",\n    \"function\": {\n        \"name\": \"schedule_meeting\",\n        \"description\": \"Schedule a meeting room for a specific date and time\",\n        \"parameters\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"date\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Meeting date in YYYY-MM-DD format\"\n                },\n                \"time\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Meeting time in HH:MM format\"\n                },\n                \"meeting_room\": {\n                    \"type\": \"string\",\n                    \"description\": \"Name of the meeting room\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"required\": [\"date\", \"time\", \"meeting_room\"],\n            \"additionalProperties\": False\n        },\n        \"strict\": True\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### How to define multiple functions\n\nYou can define multiple functions by passing a list of function definitions to the `tools` parameter.\n\nHere's an example of a list of function definitions for handling employee expenses and calculating performance bonuses:\n\n```python\ntools = [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"get_expense_balance\",\n            \"description\": \"Get expense balance for an employee\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"employee_id\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"employee_id\"],\n                \"additionalProperties\": False\n            },\n            \"strict\": True\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"function\",\n        \"function\": {\n            \"name\": \"calculate_performance_bonus\",\n            \"description\": \"Calculate yearly performance bonus for an employee\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"type\": \"object\",\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"employee_id\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Employee ID number\"\n                    },\n                    \"current_year\": {\n                        \"type\": \"integer\",\n                        \"description\": \"Year to calculate bonus for\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\"employee_id\", \"current_year\"],\n                \"additionalProperties\": False\n            },\n            \"strict\": True\n        }\n    }\n]\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Use Strict Mode**\n   - Always set `strict: True` to ensure valid function calls\n   - Define all required parameters\n   - Set `additionalProperties: False`\n2. **Use tool choice**\n   - Set `tool_choice: \"required\"` to ensure that the model will always call one or more tools\n   - The default is `tool_choice: \"auto\"` which means the model will choose a tool only if appropriate\n3. **Clear Descriptions**\n   - Write detailed function and parameter descriptions\n   - Include expected formats and units\n   - Mention any constraints or limitations\n4. **Error Handling**\n   - Validate function inputs before execution\n   - Return clear error messages\n   - Handle missing or invalid parameters",

It's a system that keeps track of changes you make to files and folders. It allows you to revert to a previous state, compare changes, etc. It's a central tool in any developer's workflow.\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) is the most popular hosting service for Git repositories. It's a website that shows your code, allows you to collaborate with others, and provides many useful tools for developers.\n\nWatch these introductory videos to learn the basics of Git and GitHub (98 min):\n\n[![Git Tutorial for Beginners: Command-Line Fundamentals (30 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/HVsySz-h9r4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/HVsySz-h9r4)\n\n[![Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course (68 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/RGOj5yH7evk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk)\n\nEssential Git Commands:\n\n```bash\n# Repository Setup\ngit init                   # Create new repo\ngit clone url              # Clone existing repo\ngit remote add origin url  # Connect to remote\n\n# Basic Workflow\ngit status                 # Check status\ngit add .                  # Stage all changes\ngit commit -m \"message\"    # Commit changes\ngit push origin main       # Push to remote\n\n# Branching\ngit branch                 # List branches\ngit checkout -b feature    # Create/switch branch\ngit merge feature          # Merge branch\ngit rebase main            # Rebase on main\n\n# History\ngit log --oneline          # View history\ngit diff commit1 commit2   # Compare commits\ngit blame file             # Show who changed what\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Commit Messages**\n\n   ```bash\n   # Good commit message format\n   type(scope): summary\n\n   Detailed description of changes.\n\n   # Examples\n   feat(api): add user authentication\n   fix(db): handle null values in query\n   ```\n\n2. **Branching Strategy**\n\n   - main: Production code\n   - develop: Integration branch\n   - feature/\\*: New features\n   - hotfix/\\*: Emergency fixes\n\n3. **Code Review**\n   - Keep PRs small (<400 lines)\n   - Use draft PRs for WIP\n   - Review your own code first\n   - Respond to all comments\n\nEssential Tools\n\n- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/): GUI client\n- [GitLens](https://gitlens.amod.io/): VS Code extension\n- [gh](https://cli.github.com/): GitHub CLI\n- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/): Git hooks",

Users can log in with their existing Google accounts.\n- It's secure: Google supports OAuth2 and OpenID Connect to handle authentication.\n\nHere's how you build a FastAPI app that identifies the user.\n\n1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console \u2013 Credentials](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) and click **Create Credentials > OAuth client ID**.\n2. Choose **Web application**, set your authorized redirect URIs (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/`).\n3. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into a `.env` file:\n\n   ```env\n   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com\n   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret\n   ```\n\n4. Create your FastAPI `app.py`:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\"python-dotenv\", \"fastapi\", \"uvicorn\", \"itsdangerous\", \"httpx\", \"authlib\"]\n# ///\n\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, Request\nfrom fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse\nfrom starlette.middleware.sessions import SessionMiddleware\nfrom authlib.integrations.starlette_client import OAuth\n\nload_dotenv()\napp = FastAPI()\napp.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, secret_key=\"create-a-random-secret-key\")\n\noauth = OAuth()\noauth.register(\n    name=\"google\",\n    client_id=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID\"),\n    client_secret=os.getenv(\"GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET\"),\n    server_metadata_url=\"https://accounts.google.com/.well-known/openid-configuration\",\n    client_kwargs={\"scope\": \"openid email profile\"},\n)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\nasync def application(request: Request):\n    user = request.session.get(\"user\")\n    # 3. For authenticated users: say hello\n    if user:\n        return f\"Hello {user['email']}\"\n    # 2. For users who have just logged in, save their details in the session\n    if \"code\" in request.query_params:\n        token = await oauth.google.authorize_access_token(request)\n        request.session[\"user\"] = token[\"userinfo\"]\n        return RedirectResponse(\"/\")\n    # 1. For users who are logging in for the first time, redirect to Google login\n    return await oauth.google.authorize_redirect(request, request.url)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import uvicorn\n    uvicorn.run(app, port=8000)\n```\n\nNow, run `uv run app.py`.\n\n1. When you visit <http://localhost:8000/> you'll be redirected to a Google login page.\n2. When you log in, you'll be redirected back to http://localhost:8000/\n3. Now you'll see the email ID you logged in with.\n\nInstead of displaying the email, you can show different content based on the user. For example:\n\n- Allow access to specfic users and not others\n- Fetch the user's personalized information\n- Display different content based on the user",

        "clean_text": "## Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG) with TypeSense\n\nHybrid RAG combines semantic (vector) search with traditional keyword search to improve retrieval accuracy and relevance. By mixing exact text matches with embedding-based similarity, you get the best of both worlds: precision when keywords are present, and semantic recall when phrasing varies. [TypeSense](https://typesense.org/) makes this easy with built-in hybrid search and automatic embedding generation.\n\nBelow is a fully self-contained Hybrid RAG tutorial using TypeSense, Python, and the command line.\n\n### Install and run TypeSense\n\n[Install TypeSense](https://typesense.org/docs/guide/install-typesense.html).\n\n```bash\nmkdir typesense-data\n\ndocker run -p 8108:8108 \\\n  -v typesense-data:/data typesense/typesense:28.0 \\\n  --data-dir /data \\\n  --api-key=secret-key \\\n  --enable-cors\n```\n\n- **`docker run`**: spins up a containerized TypeSense server on port 8108\n  - `-p 8108:8108` maps host port to container port.\n  - `-v typesense-data:/data` mounts a Docker volume for persistence.\n  - `--data-dir /data` points TypeSense at that volume.\n  - `--api-key=secret-key` secures your API.\n  - `--enable-cors` allows browser-based requests.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- Docker logs showing TypeSense startup messages, such as `Started Typesense API server`.\n- Listening on `http://0.0.0.0:8108`.\n\n### Embed and import documents into TypeSense\n\nFollow the steps in the [RAG with the CLI](rag-cli.md) tutorial to create a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n[TypeSense supports automatic embedding of documents](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#option-b-auto-embedding-generation-within-typesense). We'll use that capability.\n\nSave the following as `addnotes.py` and run it with `uv run addnotes.py`.\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\"httpx\"]\n# ///\nimport json\nimport httpx\nimport os\n\nheaders = {\"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY\": \"secret-key\"}\n\nschema = {\n    \"name\": \"notes\",\n    \"fields\": [\n        {\"name\": \"id\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\"name\": \"content\", \"type\": \"string\", \"facet\": False},\n        {\n            \"name\": \"embedding\",\n            \"type\": \"float[]\",\n            \"embed\": {\n                \"from\": [\"content\"],\n                \"model_config\": {\n                    \"model_name\": \"openai/text-embedding-3-small\",\n                    \"api_key\": os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"),\n                },\n            },\n        },\n    ],\n}\n\nwith open(\"chunks.json\", \"r\") as f:\n    chunks = [json.loads(line) for line in f.readlines()]\n\nwith httpx.Client() as client:\n    # Create the collection\n    if client.get(f\"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes\", headers=headers).status_code == 404:\n        r = client.post(\"http://localhost:8108/collections\", json=schema, headers=headers)\n\n    # Embed the chunks\n    result = client.post(\n        \"http://localhost:8108/collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace\",\n        headers={**headers, \"Content-Type\": \"text/plain\"},\n        data=\"\\n\".join(json.dumps(chunk) for chunk in chunks),\n    )\n    print(result.text)\n```\n\n- **`httpx.Client`**: an HTTP client for Python.\n- **Collection schema**: `id` and `content` fields plus an `embedding` field with auto-generated embeddings from OpenAI.\n- **Auto-embedding**: the `embed` block instructs TypeSense to call the specified model for each document.\n- **`GET /collections/notes`**: checks existence.\n- **`POST /collections`**: creates the collection.\n- **`POST /collections/notes/documents/import?action=emplace`**: bulk upsert documents, embedding them on the fly.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- A JSON summary string like `{\"success\": X, \"failed\": 0}` indicating how many docs were imported.\n- (On timeouts, re-run until all chunks are processed.)\n\n### 4. Run a hybrid search and answer a question\n\nNow, we can use a single `curl` against the Multi-Search endpoint to combine keyword and vector search as a [hybrid search](https://typesense.org/docs/28.0/api/vector-search.html#hybrid-search):\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n\npayload=$(jq -n --arg coll \"notes\" --arg q \"$Q\" \\\n  '{\n     searches: [\n       {\n         collection: $coll,\n         q:           $q,\n         query_by:    \"content,embedding\",\n         sort_by:     \"_text_match:desc\",\n         prefix:      false,\n         exclude_fields: \"embedding\"\n       }\n     ]\n   }'\n)\ncurl -s 'http://localhost:8108/multi_search' \\\n  -H \"X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY: secret-key\" \\\n  -d \"$payload\" \\\n  | jq -r '.results[].hits[].document.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"${Q} - \\$Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from the notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\n- **`query_by: \"content,embedding\"`**: tells TypeSense to score by both keyword and vector similarity.\n- **`sort_by: \"_text_match:desc\"`**: boosts exact text hits.\n- **`exclude_fields: \"embedding\"`**: keeps responses lightweight.\n- **`curl -d`**: posts the search request.\n- **`jq -r`**: extracts each hit\u2019s `content`. See [jq manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)\n- **`llm -s`** and **`uvx streamdown`**: generate and stream a grounded answer.\n\n**Expected output:**\n\n- The raw matched snippets printed first.\n- Then a concise, streamed LLM answer citing the note verbatim.",

        "clean_text": "## Images: Compression\n\nImage compression is essential when deploying apps. Often, pages have dozens of images. Image analysis runs over thousands of images. The cost of storage and bandwidth can grow over time.\n\nHere are things you should know when you're compressing images:\n\n- **Image dimensions** are the width and height of the image in pixels. This impacts image size a lot\n- **Lossless** compression (PNG, WebP) preserves exact data\n- **Lossy** compression (JPEG, WebP) removes some data for smaller files\n- **Vector** formats (SVG) scale without quality loss\n- **WebP** is the modern standard, supporting both lossy and lossless\n\nHere's a rule of thumb you can use as of 2025.\n\n- Use SVG if you can (i.e. if it's vector graphics or you can convert it to one)\n- Else, reduce the image to as small as you can, and save as (lossy or lossless) WebP\n\nCommon operations with Python:\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport io\n\nasync def compress_image(input_path: Path, output_path: Path, quality: int = 85) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Compress an image while maintaining reasonable quality.\"\"\"\n    with Image.open(input_path) as img:\n        # Convert RGBA to RGB if needed\n        if img.mode == 'RGBA':\n            img = img.convert('RGB')\n        # Optimize for web\n        img.save(output_path, 'WEBP', quality=quality, optimize=True)\n\n# Batch process images\npaths = Path('images').glob('*.jpg')\nfor p in paths:\n    await compress_image(p, p.with_suffix('.webp'))\n```\n\nCommand line tools include [cwebp](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp), [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/).\n\n```bash\n# Convert to WebP\ncwebp -q 85 input.png -o output.webp\n\n# Optimize PNG\npngquant --quality=65-80 image.png\n\n# Optimize JPEG\njpegoptim --strip-all --all-progressive --max=85 image.jpg\n\n# Convert and resize\nconvert input.jpg -resize 800x600 output.jpg\n\n# Batch convert\nmogrify -format webp -quality 85 *.jpg\n```\n\nWatch this video on modern image formats and optimization (15 min):\n\n[![Modern Image Optimization (15 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/F1kYBnY6mwg/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/F1kYBnY6mwg)\n\nTools for image optimization:\n\n- [squoosh.app](https://squoosh.app/): Browser-based compression\n- [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/): GUI tool for Mac\n- [sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/): Node.js image processing\n- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/): Python imaging library",

        "clean_text": "## JSON\n\nJSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is the de facto standard format for data exchange on the web and APIs. Its human-readable format and widespread support make it essential for data scientists working with web services, APIs, and configuration files.\n\nFor data scientists, JSON is essential when:\n\n- Working with REST APIs and web services\n- Storing configuration files and metadata\n- Parsing semi-structured data from databases like MongoDB\n- Creating data visualization specifications (e.g., Vega-Lite)\n\nWatch this comprehensive introduction to JSON (15 min):\n\n[![JSON Crash Course](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/GpOO5iKzOmY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/GpOO5iKzOmY)\n\nKey concepts to understand in JSON:\n\n- JSON only supports 6 data types: strings, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects\n- You can nest data. Arrays and objects can contain other data types, including other arrays and objects\n- Always validate. Ensure JSON is well-formed. Comm errors: Trailing commas, missing quotes, and escape characters\n\n[JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) is a format that allows you to store multiple JSON objects in a single line.\nIt's useful for logging and streaming data.\n\nTools you could use with JSON:\n\n- [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/): Validate and format JSON\n- [JSON Editor Online](https://jsoneditoronline.org/): Visual JSON editor and formatter\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): Define the structure of your JSON data\n- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Command-line JSON processor\n\nCommon Python operations with JSON:\n\n```python\nimport json\n\n# Parse JSON string\njson_str = '{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}'\ndata = json.loads(json_str)\n\n# Convert to JSON string\njson_str = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\n\n# Read JSON from file\nwith open('data.json') as f:\n    data = json.load(f)\n\n# Write JSON to file\nwith open('output.json', 'w') as f:\n    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)\n\n# Read JSON data a Pandas DataFrame. JSON data is typically stored as an array of objects.\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_json('data.json')\n\n# Read JSON lines from file into a DataFrame. JSON lines are typically one line per object.\ndf = pd.read_json('data.jsonl', lines=True)\n```\n\nPractice JSON skills with these resources:\n\n- [JSON Generator](https://json-generator.com/): Create sample JSON data\n- [JSON Path Finder](https://jsonpathfinder.com/): Learn to navigate complex JSON structures\n- [JSON Schema Validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/): Validate JSON against schemas",

        "clean_text": "# Large Language Models\n\nThis module covers the practical usage of large language models (LLMs).\n\n**LLMs incur a cost.** For the May 2025 batch, use [aipipe.org](https://aipipe.org/) as a proxy.\nEmails with `@ds.study.iitm.ac.in` get a **$1 per calendar month** allowance. (Don't exceed that.)\n\nRead the [AI Pipe documentation](https://github.com/sanand0/aipipe) to learn how to use it. But in short:\n\n1. Replace `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, i.e. `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1...` or `https://aipipe.org/openai/v1...`\n2. Replace `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the [`AIPIPE_TOKEN`](https://aipipe.org/login)\n3. Replace model names, e.g. `gpt-4.1-nano`, with `openai/gpt-4.1-nano`\n\nFor example, let's use [Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-0-flash-lite) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001) for chat completions and [Text Embedding 3 Small](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/text-embedding-3-small) via [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/) for embeddings:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\",\n    \"messages\": [{ \"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is 2 + 2?\"} }]\n  }'\n\ncurl https://aipipe.org/openai/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $AIPIPE_TOKEN\" \\\n  -d '{ \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\", \"input\": \"What is 2 + 2?\" }'\n```\n\nOr using [`llm`](https://llm.datasette.io/):\n\n```bash\nllm keys set openai --value $AIPIPE_TOKEN\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openrouter/v1\nllm 'What is 2 + 2?' -m openrouter/google/gemini-2.0-flash-lite-001\n\nexport OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://aipipe.org/openai/v1\nllm embed -c 'What is 2 + 2' -m 3-small\n```\n\n**For a 50% discount** (but slower speed), use [Flex processing](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/flex-processing) by adding `service_tier: \"flex\"` to your JSON request.\n\n## AI Proxy - Jan 2025\n\nFor the Jan 2025 batch, we had created API keys for everyone with an `iitm.ac.in` email to use `gpt-4o-mini` and `text-embedding-3-small`. Your usage is limited to **$1 per calendar month** for this course. Don't exceed that.\n\n**Use [AI Proxy](https://github.com/sanand0/aiproxy)** instead of OpenAI. Specifically:\n\n1. Replace your API to `https://api.openai.com/...` with `https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/openai/...`\n2. Replace the `OPENAI_API_KEY` with the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` that someone will give you.",

Should we copy all the things like that and then change the parameters? For example, the path will be related to some website URL. It will be used in future classes. We probably won't spend much time on image compression, but it is important from a web perspective.

I've just checked, and on the GitHub page, I don't have a requirements file. If you push it to GitHub and it's connected to GitHub, you don't need the requirements file. Something else is the issue. It's not able to pull the Flask module. You should not have to install it separately while running the file. I used `http.server`. There's example code given in GA2 itself for question 6. There's sample code there that uses `http.server`. I just modified that bit and put my function in there, and it works without any issues. The only difference is that I modified that and put the function inside that piece of code that handles the request. You don't need a separate `requirements.txt` file; Vercel can run the program without that. You still need to verify that your function actually runs. That's one thing you'll have to check. Regarding the FastAPI question, there's a logic error in your code. It shouldn't fetch all of it. Your query actually says `class` (CLASSS) without an underscore.

For 3.5, it worked, but that was more of a coincidence. If you use the documentation that is there on the AI proxy that Anand has provided, there's documentation there. If you use that documentation, then that might help. If you go back to where you get the token... You'll have to provide the documentation in this form. You'll use the requests instead of using the curl command. You just use the requests and send the inputs to it.",

It will check the similarity of a word (like \"kitten\") with all those billion words. It will check the rate of similarity between this particular word and that word. These models vary in the number of words they carry. A small model has about a billion; a medium-sized model has around 50 billion; a large model has several more. These numbers might be a bit wrong, but that's the distinction. The larger the model, the better the embeddings. Here, we have 1,056. That means it's checking the similarity of a word with 1,056 words in its database. That's how embeddings work. For creating embeddings, there's a library in NLP, actually ML, with a module called `word2vec`. It's deployed on Hugging Face.",

This involves finding a common element (class) in the HTML and using JavaScript to extract the data. The `$$` operator establishes a connection between the console and the elements tab. The `.` prefix selects elements by class, and `#` selects by ID.\n- **Method 3:** Sometimes, the data is embedded in JavaScript code within the webpage itself. You can find this in the browser's \"Sources\" tab. You can then use this JavaScript object to extract the data.",

Some of these models are available for free, but most of them are not.\n\nAn easy way to run LLMs locally is Mozilla's [Llamafile](https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile). It's a single executable file that works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. No installation or configuration needed - just download and run.\n\nWatch this Llamafile Tutorial (6 min):\n\n[![Llamafile: Local LLMs Made Easy](https://img.youtube.com/vi/d1Fnfvat6nM/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/d1Fnfvat6nM)\n\nHere's how to get started\n\n1.

From the command prompt or terminal, run `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile`.\n3. Optional: For GPU acceleration, use `Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct.Q6_K.llamafile --n-gpu-layers 35`.

Then set up your [`OPENAI_API_KEY`](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) environment variable. See [Getting started](https://github.com/simonw/llm?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started).\n\n**TDS Students**: See [Large Language Models](large-language-models.md) for instructions on how to get and use `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n\n```bash\n# Run a simple prompt\nllm 'five great names for a pet pelican'\n\n# Continue a conversation\nllm -c 'now do walruses'\n\n# Start a memory-aware chat session\nllm chat\n\n# Specify a model\nllm -m gpt-4.1-nano 'Summarize tomorrow\u2019s meeting agenda'\n\n# Extract JSON output\nllm 'List the top 5 Python viz libraries with descriptions' \\\n  --schema-multi 'name,description'\n```\n\nOr use llm without installation using [`uvx`](uv.md):\n\n```bash\n# Run llm via uvx without any prior installation\nuvx llm 'Translate \"Hello, world\" into Japanese'\n\n# Specify a model\nuvx llm -m gpt-4.1-nano 'Draft a 200-word blog post on data ethics'\n\n# Use structured JSON output\nuvx llm 'List the top 5 programming languages in 2025 with their release years' \\\n  --schema-multi 'rank,language,release_year'\n```\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Interactive prompts**: `llm '\u2026'` \u2014 Fast shell access to any LLM.\n- **Conversational flow**: `-c '\u2026'` \u2014 Continue context across prompts.\n- **Model switching**: `-m MODEL` \u2014 Use OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, and more.\n- **Structured output**: `llm json` \u2014 Produce JSON for automation.\n- **Logging & history**: `llm logs path` \u2014 Persist every prompt/response in SQLite.\n- **Web UI**: `datasette \"$(llm logs path)\"` \u2014 Browse your entire history with Datasette.\n- **Persistent chat**: `llm chat` \u2014 Keep the model in memory across multiple interactions.\n- **Plugin ecosystem**: `llm install PLUGIN` \u2014 Add support for new models, data sources, or workflows. ([Language models on the command-line - Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Jun/17/cli-language-models/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\n### Practical Uses\n\n- **Automated coding**. Generate code scaffolding, review helpers, or utilities on demand. For example, after running`llm install llm-cmd`, run `llm cmd 'Undo the last git commit'`. Inspired by [Simon\u2019s post on using LLMs for rapid tool building](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/11/using-llms-for-code/).\n- **Transcript processing**. Summarize YouTube or podcast transcripts using Gemini. See [Putting Gemini 2.5 Pro through its paces](https://www.macstories.net/mac/llm-youtube-transcripts-with-claude-and-gemini-in-shortcuts/).\n- **Commit messages**. Turn diffs into descriptive commit messages, e.g. `git diff | llm 'Write a concise git commit message explaining these changes'`. \\\n- **Data extraction**. Convert free-text into structured JSON for automation. [Structured data extraction from unstructured content using LLM schemas](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/28/llm-schemas/).",

It runs cells reactively - when you change one cell, all dependent cells update automatically, just like a spreadsheet.\n\nMarimo's cells can't be run out of order. This makes Marimo more reproducible and easier to debug, but requires a mental shift from the Jupyter/Colab way of working.\n\nIt also runs Python directly in the browser and is quite interactive. [Browse the gallery of examples](https://marimo.io/gallery). With a wide variety of interactive widgets, It's growing popular as an alternative to Streamlit for building data science web apps.\n\nCommon Operations:\n\n```python\n# Create new notebook\nuvx marimo new\n\n# Run notebook server\nuvx marimo edit notebook.py\n\n# Export to HTML\nuvx marimo export notebook.py\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Cell Dependencies**\n   - Keep cells focused and atomic\n   - Use clear variable names\n   - Document data flow between cells\n2. **Interactive Elements**\n\n   ```python\n   # Add interactive widgets\n   slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 100)\n   # Create dynamic Markdown\n   mo.md(f\"{slider} {\"\ud83d\udfe2\" * slider.value}\")\n   ```\n\n3. **Version Control**\n   - Keep notebooks are Python files\n   - Use Git to track changes\n   - Publish on [marimo.app](https://marimo.app/) for collaboration\n\n[![\"marimo: an open-source reactive notebook for Python\" - Akshay Agrawal (Nbpy2024)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/9R2cQygaoxQ/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/9R2cQygaoxQ)",

        "clean_text": "## Parsing JSON\n\nJSON is everywhere\u2014APIs, logs, configuration files\u2014and its nested or large structure can challenge memory and processing. In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\n\nFor example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\n\n[![JSON Parsing in Python](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1lxrb_ezP-g/sddefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/1lxrb_ezP-g)\n\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n\n| Tool                                        | Extract from JSON...   | Why                                                               |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell      | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing                    |\n| [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries)               | JSON in Python         | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax                        |\n| [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson)              | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently               |\n| [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns)              | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data                                  |\n| [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions)             | JSON in databases      | Combine structured and semi-structured data                       |\n| [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing)           | JSON anywhere          | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- Use Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\n- Leverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\n- Apply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\n\nPractice with these resources:\n\n- [JSONPath Online Evaluator](https://jsonpath.com/): Test JSON queries\n- [jq play](https://jqplay.org/): Interactive jq query testing\n- [DuckDB JSON Tutorial](https://duckdb.org/docs/data/json): Learn DuckDB JSON functions\n\n### Command-line JSON Processing with jq\n\n[jq](https://jqlang.org/) is a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration and can be integrated into shell scripts for automated data pipelines.\n\n**Example:** Sifting through server logs in JSON Lines format to extract error messages or aggregate metrics without launching a full-scale ETL process.\n\n```bash\n# Extract specific fields from JSONL\ncat data.jsonl | jq -c 'select(.type == \"user\") | {id, name}'\n\n# Transform JSON structure\ncat data.json | jq '.items[] | {name: .name, count: .details.count}'\n\n# Filter and aggregate\ncat events.jsonl | jq -s 'group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})'\n```\n\n### JMESPath Queries\n\n[JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) offers a declarative query language to extract and transform data from nested JSON structures without needing verbose code. It's a neat alternative when you want to quickly pull out specific values or filter collections based on conditions.\n\n**Example:** Extracting user emails or filtering out inactive records from a complex JSON payload received from a cloud service.\n\n```python\nimport jmespath\n\n# Example queries\ndata = {\n    \"locations\": [\n        {\"name\": \"Seattle\", \"state\": \"WA\", \"info\": {\"population\": 737015}},\n        {\"name\": \"Portland\", \"state\": \"OR\", \"info\": {\"population\": 652503}}\n    ]\n}\n\n# Find all cities with population > 700000\ncities = jmespath.search(\"locations[?info.population > `700000`].name\", data)\n```\n\n### Streaming with ijson\n\nLoading huge JSON files all at once can quickly exhaust system memory. [ijson](https://ijson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) lets you stream and process JSON incrementally. This method is ideal when your JSON file is too large or when you only need to work with part of the data.\n\n**Example:** Processing a continuous feed from an API that returns a large JSON array, such as sensor data or event logs, while filtering on the fly.\n\n```python\nimport ijson\n\nasync def process_large_json(filepath: str) -> list:\n    \"\"\"Process a large JSON file without loading it entirely into memory.\"\"\"\n    results = []\n\n    with open(filepath, 'rb') as file:\n        # Stream objects under the 'items' key\n        parser = ijson.items(file, 'items.item')\n        async for item in parser:\n            if item['value'] > 100:  # Process conditionally\n                results.append(item)\n\n    return results\n```\n\n### Pandas JSON Columns\n\n[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) makes it easy to work with tabular data that includes JSON strings. When you receive API data where one column holds nested JSON, flattening these structures lets you analyze and visualize the data using familiar DataFrame operations.\n\n**Example:** Flattening customer records stored as nested JSON in a CSV file to extract demographic details and spending patterns.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Parse JSON strings in a column\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'json_col': ['{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}', '{\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}']})\ndf['parsed'] = df['json_col'].apply(pd.json_normalize)\n\n# Normalize nested JSON columns\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\ndf_normalized = pd.json_normalize(\n    df['nested_json'].apply(json.loads),\n    record_path=['items'],        # List of nested objects to unpack\n    meta=['id', 'timestamp']      # Keep these columns from parent\n)\n```\n\n### SQL JSON Functions\n\n[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL:2016) supports built-in JSON functions allow you to query and manipulate JSON stored within relational databases.\nThese are implemented by most popular databases, including\n[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/json1.html),\n[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), and\n[MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/json-function-reference.html).\nThis is especially handy when you have a hybrid data model, combining structured tables with semi-structured JSON columns.\n\n**Example:** An application that stores user settings or application logs as JSON in a SQLite database, enabling quick lookups and modifications without external JSON parsing libraries.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract(data, '$.name') as name,\n    json_extract(data, '$.details.age') as age\nFROM users\nWHERE json_extract(data, '$.active') = true\n```\n\n### DuckDB JSON Processing\n\n[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) shines when analyzing JSON/JSONL files directly, making it a powerful tool for data analytics without the overhead of loading entire datasets into memory. Its SQL-like syntax simplifies exploratory analysis on nested data.\n\n**Example:** Performing ad-hoc analytics on streaming JSON logs from a web service, such as calculating average response times or aggregating user behavior metrics.\n\n```sql\nSELECT\n    json_extract_string(data, '$.user.name') as name,\n    avg(json_extract_float(data, '$.metrics.value')) as avg_value\nFROM read_json_auto('data/*.jsonl')\nGROUP BY 1\nHAVING avg_value > 100\n```",

        "clean_text": "# Project 1 - LLM-based Automation Agent\n\nThis project is due on 16 Feb 2025 EoD IST. Results will be announced by 26 Feb 2025.\n\nFor questions, [use this Discourse thread](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/project-1-llm-based-automation-agent-discussion-thread-tds-jan-2025/164277).\n\n## Background\n\nYou have joined the operations team at **DataWorks Solutions**, a company that processes large volumes of log files, reports, and code artifacts to generate actionable insights for internal stakeholders. In order to improve operational efficiency and consistency, the company has mandated that routine tasks be automated and integrated into their Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.\n\nDue to the unpredictable nature of incoming data (from logs, ticket systems, source code, surveys, etc.) the team has decided to use a Large Language Model (LLM) as an intermediate transformer. In this role, the LLM will perform small, reasonably deterministic tasks.\n\nYour assignment is to build an automation agent that accepts plain\u2011English tasks, carries out the required (multi\u2011step) process leveraging an LLM where required. The finished processing artifacts must be exactly verifiable against pre\u2011computed expected results.\n\n## Create an API\n\nWrite an application that exposes an API with the following endpoints:\n\n- **POST `/run?task=<task description>`**\n  Executes a plain\u2011English task. The agent should parse the instruction, execute one or more internal steps (including taking help from an LLM), and produce the final output.\n  - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response\n  - If unsuccessful because of an error in the task, return a HTTP 400 Bad Request response\n  - If unsuccessful because of an error in the agent, return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error response\n  - The body may optionally contain any useful information in each of these cases\n- **GET `/read?path=<file path>`**\n  Returns the content of the specified file. This is critical for verification of the exact output.\n  - If successful, return a HTTP 200 OK response with the file content as plain text\n  - If the file does not exist, return a HTTP 404 Not Found response and an empty body\n\n## Phase A: Handle Operations Tasks\n\nThe DataWorks operations team has identified these tasks that need to be automated:\n\n- **A1**. Install `uv` (if required) and run `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tds-2025-01/project-1/datagen.py` with `${user.email}` as the only argument. (**NOTE**: This will generate data files required for the next tasks.)\n- **A2**. Format the contents of `/data/format.md` using `prettier@3.4.2`, updating the file in-place\n- **A3**. The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt`\n- **A4**. Sort the array of contacts in `/data/contacts.json` by `last_name`, then `first_name`, and write the result to `/data/contacts-sorted.json`\n- **A5**. Write the first line of the 10 most recent `.log` file in `/data/logs/` to `/data/logs-recent.txt`, most recent first\n- **A6**. Find all Markdown (`.md`) files in `/data/docs/`. For each file, extract the first occurrance of each H1 (i.e. a line starting with `# `). Create an index file `/data/docs/index.json` that maps each filename (without the `/data/docs/` prefix) to its title (e.g. `{\"README.md\": \"Home\", \"path/to/large-language-models.md\": \"Large Language Models\", ...}`)\n- **A7**. `/data/email.txt` contains an email message. Pass the content to an LLM with instructions to extract the sender's email address, and write just the email address to `/data/email-sender.txt`\n- **A8**. `/data/credit-card.png` contains a credit card number. Pass the image to an LLM, have it extract the card number, and write it without spaces to `/data/credit-card.txt`\n- **A9**. `/data/comments.txt` contains a list of comments, one per line. Using embeddings, find the most similar pair of comments and write them to `/data/comments-similar.txt`, one per line\n- **A10**. The SQLite database file `/data/ticket-sales.db` has a `tickets` with columns `type`, `units`, and `price`. Each row is a customer bid for a concert ticket. What is the total sales of all the items in the \"Gold\" ticket type? Write the number in `/data/ticket-sales-gold.txt`\n\nDevelopers will call the `/run?task=` endpoint with a task description **similar** (but certainly not identical) to the ones listed above.\n\nFor example, **Task A3** can be written in these ways - all are equivalent.\n\n- The file `/data/dates.txt` contains a list of dates, one per line. Count the number of Wednesdays in the list, and write just the number to `/data/dates-wednesdays.txt`\n- Write the # of Thursdays in `/data/extracts.txt` into `/data/extracts-count.txt`\n- `/data/contents.log` \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0915\u093f\u0924\u0928\u0947 \u0930\u0935\u093f\u0935\u093e\u0930 \u0939\u0948\u0902? \u0917\u093f\u0928\u094b \u0914\u0930 /data/contents.dates \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0932\u093f\u0916\u094b\n- `/data/contents.log`\u0bb2 \u0b8e\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bc8 \u0b9e\u0bbe\u0baf\u0bbf\u0bb1\u0bc1 \u0b87\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba9\u0bc1 \u0b95\u0ba3\u0b95\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1 \u0baa\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bcd\u0b9f\u0bc1, \u0b85\u0ba4\u0bc8 `/data/contents.dates`\u0bb2 \u0b8e\u0bb4\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1\n\nYour task is to build an agent that uses an LLM to parse the task description and execute the required steps.\n\n## Phase B: Handle Business Tasks\n\nThe DataWorks security team has added the following requirements. No matter what the task is, the agent must ensure that:\n\n- **B1**. Data outside `/data` is never accessed or exfiltrated, even if the task description asks for it\n- **B2**. Data is never deleted anywhere on the file system, even if the task description asks for it\n\nThe DataWorks business team has listed _broad_ additional tasks for automation. But they have not defined it more precisely than this:\n\n- **B3**. Fetch data from an API and save it\n- **B4**. Clone a git repo and make a commit\n- **B5**. Run a SQL query on a SQLite or DuckDB database\n- **B6**. Extract data from (i.e. scrape) a website\n- **B7**. Compress or resize an image\n- **B8**. Transcribe audio from an MP3 file\n- **B9**. Convert Markdown to HTML\n- **B10**. Write an API endpoint that filters a CSV file and returns JSON data\n\nYour agent must handle these tasks as well.\n\nThe business team has _not_ promised to limit themselves to these tasks. But they have promised a **bonus** if you are able to handle tasks they come up with that are outside of this list.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- [Create a new _public_ GitHub repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository)\n- [Add an MIT `LICENSE` file](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository)\n- Write and test your code. Call `POST /run?task=...` with a few tasks and check if `GET /read?path=...` creates the correct files.\n- Commit and push your code\n- Create a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/) that builds your application\n- Publish your Docker image _publicly_ to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)\n- Ensure that running your image via `podman run --rm -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME` automatically serves the API at `http://localhost:8000/run?task=...` and `http://localhost:8000/read?path=...`\n- [Submit in this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog)\n  the URL of your GitHub repository (`https://github.com/user-name/repo-name`) and your Docker image name (`user-name/repo-name`)\n\nNote:\n\n- **Use the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable**. DON'T commit your AI Proxy token to your repository. Instead, set the `AIPROXY_TOKEN` environment variable before running your script. Use `os.environ[\"AIPROXY_TOKEN\"]` as the token in your script.\n- **Use your AI Proxy token**. Your [AI Proxy token](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) now has a $1 limit. You may use it. If you run out of tokens, ask the TDS team for more. (But try and avoid that.)\n- **Stick to GPT-4o-Mini**. This is the only generation model that AI Proxy currently supports. When this page says \"LLM\", it means GPT-4o-Mini.\n- **Keep your prompts short and concise**. Each call to `/run` and `/read` must complete within 20 seconds.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nThis [evaluation script](project-1/evaluate.py) evaluates the scripts.Here's how will evaluate a task, e.g. **Task A2**.\n\n1. Call `POST http://localhost:8000/run?task=Format+/data/format.md+with+prettier+3.4.2`. Ensure that the respose is a HTTP 200.\n   - Note: The task may be worded differently. It may use a different prettier version. But the broad task is the same.\n2. Call `GET http://localhost:8000/read?path=/data/format.md` and get the revised file contents.\n3. Verify that the response was formatted using `prettier@3.4.2`.\n\nHere's how we will score the results.\n\n- **Pre-requisites**: Your repository **MUST** meet the following criteria to be eligible for evaluation\n  - Your GitHub repository exists and is publicly accessible\n  - Your GitHub repository has a `LICENSE` file with the MIT license\n  - Your GitHub repository has a valid `Dockerfile`\n  - Your Docker image is publicly accessible and runs via `podman run -e AIPROXY_TOKEN=$AIPROXY_TOKEN -p 8000:8000 $IMAGE_NAME`\n  - Your Docker image uses the same Dockerfile as in your GitHub repository\n- **Phase A: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase A task that the agent handles correctly.\n  - We will run an evaluation script that will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output\n- **Phase B: 10 marks**. 1 mark for each Phase B task that the agent handles correctly.\n  - The evaluation script will call `https://localhost:8000/run?task=...` on the task and call `https://localhost:8000/read?path=...` to verify the output\n- **Bonus: Additional tasks**. We _may_ pass additional tasks beyond the list above. If your code handles them correctly, you get 1 bonus mark per task.\n- **Bonus: Code diversity**. You're encouraged to copy code and learn from each other. We encourage diversity too. We will evaluate code similarity and give bonus marks for most unique responses. (That is, if your response is similar to a lot of others, you won't get bonus marks.)\n\nYour score will be the sum of the marks above. No normalization, i.e. whether it's 0/20 or 22/20, what you get is what you get.\n\nThis execution will be automated via:\n\n- [`validate.py`](project-1/validate.py) to check the pre-requisites and generate the eligible `images.txt`\n- `export AIPROXY_TOKEN=...` to set the AI Proxy token\n- [`run.sh`](project-1/run.sh) to evaluate all submissions.",

You have just enrolled in the [Tools in Data Science](https://tds.s-anand.net/) course.\n\nOut of kindness for your teaching assistants, you have decided to build an API that can automatically answer student questions on their behalf based on:\n\n- [Course content](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/2025-01) with content for TDS Jan 2025 as on 15 Apr 2025.\n- [TDS Discourse posts](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/c/courses/tds-kb/34) with content from 1 Jan 2025 - 14 Apr 2025.\n\n## Scrape the data\n\nTo make sure you can answer these questions, you will need to extract the data from the above source.\n\n## Create an API\n\nYour application exposes an API endpoint. You may host it anywhere. Let's assume it's at `https://app.example.com/api/`.\n\nThe endpoint must accept a POST request, e.g. `POST https://app.example.com/api/` with a student question as well as optional base64 file attachments as JSON.\n\nFor example, here's how anyone can make a request:\n\n```bash\ncurl \"https://app.example.com/api/\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d \"{\\\"question\\\": \\\"Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?\\\", \\\"image\\\": \\\"$(base64 -w0 project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\\\"}\"\n```\n\nThis is a [real question](https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939) and uses this [screenshot](project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp):\n\n![Screenshot](project-tds-virtual-ta-q1.webp)\n\nThe response must be a JSON object like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"answer\": \"You must use `gpt-3.5-turbo-0125`, even if the AI Proxy only supports `gpt-4o-mini`. Use the OpenAI API directly for this question.\",\n  \"links\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/4\",\n      \"text\": \"Use the model that\u2019s mentioned in the question.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://discourse.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/t/ga5-question-8-clarification/155939/3\",\n      \"text\": \"My understanding is that you just have to use a tokenizer, similar to what Prof. Anand used, to get the number of tokens and multiply that by the given rate.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Evaluate your application\n\nHere are a few [sample questions and evaluation parameters](project-tds-virtual-ta-promptfoo.yaml \":ignore\").

        "clean_text": "## Prompt Engineering\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts for large language models (LLMs).\n\nOne of the best ways to approach prompt engineering is to think of LLMs as a smart colleague (with amnesia) who needs explicit instructions.\n\nThe most authoritative guides are from the LLM providers themselves:\n\n- [Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/)\n- [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/introduction-prompt-design)\n- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)\n\nHere are some best practices:\n\n### Use prompt optimizers\n\nThey rewrite your prompt to improve it. Explore:\n\n- [Anthropic Prompt Optimizer](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/prompt-improver)\n- [OpenAI Prompt Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-generation)\n- [Google AI-powered prompt writing tools](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/ai-powered-prompt-writing)\n\n### Be clear, direct, and detailed\n\nBe explicit and thorough. Include all necessary context, goals, and details so the model understands the full picture.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain gravitation lensing._ (Reason: Vague and lacks context or detail.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy._ (Reason: Specifies the audience, scope, and focus.)\n\n> When you ask a question, don\u2019t be vague. Spell it out. Give every detail the listener needs.\n> The clearer you are, the better the answer you\u2019ll get.\n> For example, don't just say, Explain Gravitation Lensing.\n> Say, Explain the concept of gravitational lensing to a high school student who understands basic physics, including how it\u2019s observed and its significance in astronomy.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/be-clear-and-direct)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-include-details-in-your-query-to-get-more-relevant-answers)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/clear-instructions)\n\n### Give examples\n\nProvide 2-3 relevant examples to guide the model on the style, structure, or format you expect. This helps the model produce outputs consistent with your desired style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: No examples or reference points given.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  _Explain how to tie a bow tie. For example:_\n\n  1. _To tie a shoelace, you cross the laces and pull them tight..._\n  2. _To tie a necktie, you place it around the collar and loop it through..._\n\n  _Now, apply a similar step-by-step style to describe how to tie a bow tie._ (Reason: Provides clear examples and a pattern to follow.)\n\n> Give examples to the model. If you want someone to build a house, show them a sketch. Don\u2019t just say \u2018build something.\u2019\n> Giving examples is like showing a pattern. It makes everything easier to follow.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/multishot-prompting)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-provide-examples)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/few-shot-examples)\n\n### Think step by step\n\nInstruct the model to reason through the problem step by step. This leads to more logical, well-structured answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied?_ (Reason: No prompt for structured reasoning.)\n- **GOOD**: _Given this transcript, is the customer satisfied? Think step by step._ (Reason: Directly instructs the model to break down reasoning into steps.)\n\n> Ask the model to think step by step. Don\u2019t ask the model to just give the final answer right away.\n> That's like asking someone to answer with the first thing that pops into their head.\n> Instead, ask them to break down their thought process into simple moves \u2014 like showing each rung of a ladder as they climb.\n> For example, when thinking step by step, the model could, A, list each customer question, B, find out if it was addressed, and C, decide that the agent answered only 2 out of the 3 questions.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#strategy-give-models-time-to-think)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/break-down-prompts)\n\n### Assign a role\n\nSpecify a role or persona for the model. This provides context and helps tailor the response style.\n\n- **BAD**: _Explain how to fix a software bug._ (Reason: No role or perspective given.)\n- **GOOD**: _You are a seasoned software engineer. Explain how to fix a software bug in legacy code, including the debugging and testing process._ (Reason: Assigns a clear, knowledgeable persona, guiding the style and depth.)\n\n> Tell the model who they are. Maybe they\u2019re a seasoned software engineer fixing a legacy bug, or an experienced copy editor revising a publication.\n> By clearly telling the model who they are, you help them speak with just the right expertise and style.\n> Suddenly, your explanation sounds like it\u2019s coming from a true specialist, not a random voice.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/system-prompts)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-ask-the-model-to-adopt-a-persona)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/assign-role)\n\n### Use XML to structure your prompt\n\nUse XML tags to separate different parts of the prompt clearly. This helps the model understand structure and requirements.\n\n- **BAD**: _Here\u2019s what I want: Provide a summary and then an example._ (Reason: Unstructured, no clear separation of tasks.)\n- **GOOD**:\n  ```xml\n  <instructions>\n    Provide a summary of the concept of machine learning.\n  </instructions>\n  <example>\n    Then provide a simple, concrete example of a machine learning application (e.g., an email spam filter).\n  </example>\n  ```\n  (Reason: Uses XML tags to clearly distinguish instructions from examples.)\n\n> Think of your request like a box. XML tags are neat little labels on that box.\n> They help keep parts sorted, so nothing gets lost in the shuffle.\n\n[Anthropic](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags)\n| [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#tactic-use-delimiters-to-clearly-indicate-distinct-parts-of-the-input)\n| [Google](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/prompts/structure-prompts)\n\n### Use Markdown to format your output\n\nEncourage the model to use Markdown for headings, lists, code blocks, and other formatting features to produce structured, easily readable answers.\n\n- **BAD**: _Give me the steps in plain text._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions, less readable.)\n- **GOOD**: _Provide the steps in a markdown-formatted list with ### headings for each section and numbered bullet points._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use Markdown formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n- **BAD**: _Correct the spelling and show the corrections._ (Reason: No specific formatting instructions)\n- **GOOD**: _Correct the spelling, showing &lt;ins&gt;additions&lt;/ins&gt; and &lt;del&gt;deletions&lt;/del&gt;._ (Reason: Directly instructs to use HTML formatting, making output more structured and clear.)\n\n> Markdown is a simple formatting language that all models understand.\n> You can have them add neat headings, sections, bold highlights, and bullet points.\n> These make complex documents more scannable and easy on the eyes.\n\n### Use JSON for machine-readable output\n\nWhen you need structured data, ask for a JSON-formatted response. This ensures the output is machine-readable and organized.\n\n- **BAD**: _Just list the items._ (Reason: Unstructured plain text makes parsing harder.)\n- **GOOD**:\n\n  ````markdown\n  Organize as an array of objects in a JSON format, like this:\n\n  ```json\n  [\n    { \"name\": \"Item 1\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 1\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 2\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 2\" },\n    { \"name\": \"Item 3\", \"description\": \"Description of Item 3\" }\n  ]\n  ```\n  ````\n\n  (Reason: Instructing JSON format ensures structured, machine-readable output.)\n\nNote: Always use [JSON schema](playground#attachments) if possible. [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) is a way to describe the structure of JSON data. An easy way to get the JSON schema is to give ChatGPT sample output and ask it to generate the schema.\n\n> Imagine you\u2019re organizing data for a big project. Plain text is like dumping everything into one messy pile \u2014 it\u2019s hard to find what you need later.\n> JSON, on the other hand, is like packing your data into neat, labeled boxes within boxes.\n> Everything has its place: fields like \u2018name,\u2019 \u2018description,\u2019 and \u2018value\u2019 make the data easy to read, especially for machines.\n> For example, instead of just listing items, you can structure them as a JSON array, with each item as an object.\n> That way, when you hand it to a program, it\u2019s all clear and ready to use.\n\n### Prefer Yes/No answers\n\nConvert rating or percentage questions into Yes/No queries. LLMs handle binary choices better than numeric scales.\n\n- **BAD**: _On a scale of 1-10, how confident are you that this method works?_ (Reason: Asks for a numeric rating, which can be imprecise.)\n- **GOOD**: _Is this method likely to work as intended? Please give a reasoning and then answer Yes or No._ (Reason: A binary question simplifies the response and clarifies what\u2019s being asked.)\n\n> Don\u2019t ask \u2018On a scale of one to five...\u2019. Models are not good with numbers.\n> They don't know how to grade something 7 versus 8 on a 10 point scale. \u2018Yes or no?\u2019 is simple. It\u2019s clear. It\u2019s quick.\n> So, break your question into simple parts that they can answer with just a yes or a no.\n\n### Ask for reason first, then the answer\n\nInstruct the model to provide its reasoning steps _before_ stating the final answer. This makes it less likely to justify itself and more likely to think deeper, leading to more accurate results.\n\n- **BAD**: _What is the best route to take?_ (Reason: Direct question without prompting reasoning steps first.)\n- **GOOD**: _First, explain your reasoning step by step for how you determine the best route. Then, after you\u2019ve reasoned it out, state your final recommendation for the best route._ (Reason: Forces the model to show its reasoning process before giving the final answer.)\n\n> BEFORE making its final choice, have the model talk through their thinking. Reasoning first, answer second.\n> That way, the model won't be tempted to justify an answer that they gave impulsively. It is also more likely to think deeper.\n\n### Use proper spelling and grammar\n\nA well-written, grammatically correct prompt clarifies expectations. Poorly structured prompts can confuse the model.\n\n- **BAD**: _xplin wht the weirless netork do? make shur to giv me a anser??_ (Reason: Poor spelling and unclear instructions.)\n- **GOOD**: _Explain what a wireless network does. Please provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ (Reason: Proper spelling and clarity lead to a more coherent response.)\n\n> If your question sounds like gibberish, expect a messy answer. Speak cleanly.\n> When you do, the response will be much clearer.\n\n## Video Tutorials\n\nWatch [Prompt Engineering Tutorial \u2013 Master ChatGPT and LLM Responses (41 min)](https://youtu.be/_ZvnD73m40o).

        "clean_text": "## Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with the CLI\n\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) combines retrieval (searching a knowledge base) with generation (using an LLM) to produce answers grounded in your own documents. Instead of relying solely on a general-purpose LLM, RAG lets you feed it the most relevant chunks from your corpus at query time, improving accuracy, reducing hallucinations, and allowing you to answer domain\u2011specific questions without fine\u2011tuning.\n\nIn particular, you can answer questions that are hard to answer with a keyword search. For example:\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n# Answer: fat arrow\n\nQ=\"What lets you walk every child node of a ts.Node?\"\n# Answer: node.getChildren()\n\nQ=\"What are code pieces like comments and whitespace that aren\u2019t in the AST called?\"\n# Answer: trivia\n\nQ=\"Which operator converts any value into an explicit boolean?\"\n# Answer: !!\n```\n\nYou can implement RAG entirely from your terminal, without writing a single line of application code. Below is a step\u2011by\u2011step example using the TypeScript book as a data source.\n\n### 1. Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/basarat/typescript-book\ncd typescript-book\n```\n\n- `--depth 1` fetches only the latest commit to minimize download size.\n- `cd typescript-book` moves into the project folder.\n\nYou'll now be in a new folder `typescript-book` containing the repo.\n\n### 2. Split Markdown files into chunks\n\n```bash\n(\n  shopt -s globstar\n  for f in **/*.md; do\n    uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt \"$f\" --model gpt-4o --limit 4096 --separator \"===SPLIT===\" \\\n    | sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/' \\\n    | jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\" '\n      split(\"===SPLIT===\")[1:]\n      | to_entries\n      | map({\n          id: ($file + \"#\" + (.key | tostring)),\n          content: .value\n        })[]\n    '\n  done\n) | tee chunks.json\n```\n\n- `shopt -s globstar`: lets `**/*.md` match Markdown files in all subdirectories. [bash shopt manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Shopt-Builtin.html)\n- `uvx --from split_markdown4gpt mdsplit4gpt`: [a tool](https://github.com/twardoch/split-markdown4gpt) that splits Markdown into LLM\u2011sized chunks:\n  - `--model gpt-4o`: uses GPT\u20114o token limits\n  - `--limit 4096`: max tokens per chunk\n  - `--separator \"===SPLIT===\"`: custom split marker\n- `sed '1s/^/===SPLIT===\\n/'`: ensures the very first chunk starts with the separator (GNU sed manual)\n- `jq -R -s -c --arg file \"$f\"`: uses [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/) to convert chunks to JSON\n  - `-R`: read raw input\n  - `-s`: slurp entire input into a single string\n  - `-c`: compact JSON output\n  - builds an array of objects `{id, content}`, where `id` is `filename#chunkIndex`\n- `tee chunks.json`: writes the resulting JSON array to `chunks.json` while printing it to stdout.\n\nYou'll now have a `chunks.json` that has one `{id, content}` JSON object per line.\n\n### 3. Generate embeddings\n\n```bash\nllm embed-multi typescript-book --model 3-small --store --format nl chunks.json\n```\n\n- `embed-multi`: computes embeddings for each entry in `chunks.json`.\n- `typescript-book`: a namespace or collection name for storage.\n- `--model 3-small`: selects the embedding model.\n- `--store`: save embeddings in the default backend.\n- `--format nl`: input is newline\u2011delimited JSON. [llm CLI embed-multi](https://github.com/kerenter/llm#embed-multi)\n\nThis stores the embeddings in a collection called `typescript-book`.\n\n```bash\nllm collections path  # shows where the collections are stored\nllm collections delete typescript-book  # deletes the typescript-book collection\n```\n\n### 4. Find similar topics\n\n```bash\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\n```\n\nThis returns the 3 chunksmost similar to the question posed.\n\n- `similar`: retrieves the top `n` most similar chunks from the embeddings store.\n- `-n 3`: return three results.\n- `-c`: the user\u2019s query string.\n\n### 5. Answer a question using retrieved context\n\n```bash\nQ=\"What does the author affectionately call the => syntax?\"\nllm similar typescript-book -n 3 -c \"$Q\" \\\n  | jq '.content' \\\n  | llm -s \"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\" \\\n  | uvx streamdown\n```\n\nThis answers the question in natural language following these steps:\n\n1. Store the query in `Q`.\n2. Retrieve the top 3 matching chunks.\n3. `jq '.content'` extracts just the text snippets.\n4. Pipe into `llm -s`, instructing the model:\n   - `-s`: stream a prompt directly to the LLM.\n   - `\"$Q - Answer ONLY from these notes. Cite verbatim from notes.\"`: ensures the response is grounded.\n5. `uvx streamdown` formats the streamed LLM output for easy reading.\n\n<!--\n\nMore questions that cannot be answered via keyword search:\n\nQ=\"Which shorthand lets you both declare and initialize a class member in one go?\"\n# Answer: constructor(public x:number)\n\nQ=\"What syntax allows initializing class fields outside the constructor?\"\n# Answer: property initializer\n\nQ=\"What property name do discriminated unions use to narrow types?\"\n# Answer: kind\n\nQ=\"Which keyword pauses and resumes execution in generator functions?\"\n# Answer: yield\n\nQ=\"What JSON-style syntax defines overloads in a callable type annotation?\"\n# Answer: { (foo: string): string; }\n\nQ=\"What filename do you use to declare globals available across your entire TS project?\"\n# Answer: global.d.ts\n\nQ=\"What TS helper wraps subclass constructors for ES5-style inheritance?\"\n# Answer: __extends\n\nQ=\"What option in tsconfig.json turns on ES7 decorator support?\"\n# Answer: experimentalDecorators\n\nQ=\"What directive in tsconfig.json preserves raw JSX output?\"\n# Answer: jsx: \"preserve\"\n\nQ=\"In async/await, what wraps generator code to return a Promise?\"\n# Answer: __awaiter\n\nQ=\"What config field controls which .ts/.js files to include in compilation?\"\n# Answer: include / exclude\n\nQ=\"What npm package is recommended for structural deep-equality checks?\"\n# Answer: deep-equal\n-->",

        "clean_text": "## REST APIs\n\nREST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are the standard way to build web services that allow different systems to communicate over HTTP. They use standard HTTP methods and JSON for data exchange.\n\nWatch this comprehensive introduction to REST APIs (52 min):\n\n[![REST API Crash Course - Introduction + Full Python API Tutorial (52)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/qbLc5a9jdXo/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/qbLc5a9jdXo)\n\nKey Concepts:\n\n1. **HTTP Methods**\n   - `GET`: Retrieve data\n   - `POST`: Create new data\n   - `PUT/PATCH`: Update existing data\n   - `DELETE`: Remove data\n2. **Status Codes**\n   - `2xx`: Success (200 OK, 201 Created)\n   - `4xx`: Client errors (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found)\n   - `5xx`: Server errors (500 Internal Server Error)\n\nHere's a minimal REST API using FastAPI. Run this `server.py` script via `uv run server.py`:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.13\"\n# dependencies = [\n#     \"fastapi\",\n#     \"uvicorn\",\n# ]\n# ///\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\nfrom typing import Dict, List\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n# Create a list of items that will act like a database\nitems: List[Dict[str, float | int | str]] = []\n\n# Create a GET endpoint that returns all items\n@app.get(\"/items\")\nasync def get_items() -> List[Dict[str, float | int | str]]:\n    return items\n\n# Create a GET endpoint that returns a specific item by ID\n@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\nasync def get_item(item_id: int) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:\n    if item := next((i for i in items if i[\"id\"] == item_id), None):\n        return item\n    raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail=\"Item not found\")\n\n# Create a POST endpoint that creates a new item\n@app.post(\"/items\")\nasync def create_item(item: Dict[str, float | str]) -> Dict[str, float | int | str]:\n    new_item = {\"id\": len(items) + 1, \"name\": item[\"name\"], \"price\": float(item[\"price\"])}\n    items.append(new_item)\n    return new_item\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    import uvicorn\n    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n```\n\nTest the API with curl:\n\n```bash\n# Get all items\ncurl http://localhost:8000/items\n\n# Create an item\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8000/items \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Book\", \"price\": 29.99}'\n\n# Get specific item\ncurl http://localhost:8000/items/1\n```\n\nBest Practices:\n\n1. **Use Nouns for Resources**\n   - Good: `/users`, `/posts`\n   - Bad: `/getUsers`, `/createPost`\n2. **Version Your API**\n   ```\n   /api/v1/users\n   /api/v2/users\n   ```\n3. **Handle Errors Consistently**\n   ```python\n   {\n     \"error\": \"Not Found\",\n     \"message\": \"User 123 not found\",\n     \"status_code\": 404\n   }\n   ```\n4. **Use Query Parameters for Filtering**\n   ```\n   /api/posts?status=published&category=tech\n   ```\n5. **Implement Pagination**\n   ```\n   /api/posts?page=2&limit=10\n   ```\n\nTools:\n\n- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/): API testing and documentation\n- [Swagger/OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/): API documentation\n- [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/): Modern command-line HTTP client\n- [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/): API request/response validation\n\nLearn more about REST APIs:\n\n- [REST API Design Best Practices](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/03/02/best-practices-for-rest-api-design/)\n- [Microsoft REST API Guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/api-guidelines)\n- [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design)",

        "clean_text": "## Scheduled Scraping with GitHub Actions\n\nGitHub Actions provides an excellent platform for running web scrapers on a schedule. This tutorial shows how to automate data collection from websites using GitHub Actions workflows.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Scheduling**: Use [cron syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) to run scrapers at specific times\n- **Dependencies**: Install required packages like `httpx`, `lxml`\n- **Data Storage**: Save scraped data to files and commit back to the repository\n- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for network issues and HTML parsing\n- **Rate Limiting**: Respect website terms of service and implement delays between requests\n\nHere's a sample `scrape.py` that scrapes the IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml:\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport httpx\nfrom datetime import datetime, UTC\nfrom lxml import html\nfrom typing import List, Dict\n\n\ndef scrape_imdb() -> List[Dict[str, str]]:\n    \"\"\"Scrape IMDb Top 250 movies using httpx and lxml.\n\n    Returns:\n        List of dictionaries containing movie title, year, and rating.\n    \"\"\"\n    headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; IMDbBot/1.0)\"}\n    response = httpx.get(\"https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/\", headers=headers)\n    response.raise_for_status()\n\n    tree = html.fromstring(response.text)\n    movies = []\n\n    for item in tree.cssselect(\".ipc-metadata-list-summary-item\"):\n        title = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-title__text\")\n            else None\n        )\n        year = (\n            item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".cli-title-metadata span\")\n            else None\n        )\n        rating = (\n            item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")[0].text_content()\n            if item.cssselect(\".ipc-rating-star\")\n            else None\n        )\n\n        if title and year and rating:\n            movies.append({\"title\": title, \"year\": year, \"rating\": rating})\n\n    return movies\n\n\n# Scrape data and save with timestamp\nnow = datetime.now(UTC)\nwith open(f'imdb-top250-{now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")}.json', \"a\") as f:\n    f.write(json.dumps({\"timestamp\": now.isoformat(), \"movies\": scrape_imdb()}) + \"\\n\")\n```\n\nHere's a sample `.github/workflows/imdb-top250.yml` that runs the scraper daily and saves the data:\n\n```yaml\nname: Scrape IMDb Top 250\n\non:\n  schedule:\n    # Runs at 00:00 UTC every day\n    - cron: \"0 0 * * *\"\n  workflow_dispatch: # Allow manual triggers\n\njobs:\n  scrape-imdb:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    permissions:\n      contents: write\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Checkout repository\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n      - name: Install uv\n        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v5\n\n      - name: Run scraper\n        run: | # python\n          uv run --with httpx,lxml,cssselect python scrape.py\n\n      - name: Commit and push changes\n        run: |\n          git config --local user.email \"github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com\"\n          git config --local user.name \"github-actions[bot]\"\n          git add *.json\n          git commit -m \"Update IMDb Top 250 data [skip ci]\" || exit 0\n          git push\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Cache Dependencies**: Use GitHub's caching to speed up package installation\n2. **Handle Errors**: Implement retries and error logging\n3. **Rate Limiting**: Add delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers\n4. **Data Validation**: Verify scraped data structure before saving\n5. **Monitoring**: Set up notifications for workflow failures\n\n### Tools and Resources\n\n- [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/): Async HTTP client\n- [GitHub Actions Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions)\n- [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)\n\n### Video Tutorials\n\n[![How to run Github Actions on a Schedule](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/eJG86J200nM/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/eJG86J200nM)",

It's lightweight but very scalable and powerful.\n\nWatch these introductory videos to understand SQLite and how it's used in Python (34 min):\n\n[![SQLite Introduction - Beginners Guide to SQL and Databases (22 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8Xyn8R9eKB8/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8Xyn8R9eKB8)\n\n[![SQLite Backend for Beginners - Create Quick Databases with Python and SQL (13 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/Ohj-CqALrwk/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/Ohj-CqALrwk)\n\nThere are many non-relational databases (NoSQL) like [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/), [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/), etc. that you should know about and we may cover later.\n\nCore Concepts:\n\n```sql\n-- Create a table\nCREATE TABLE users (\n    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    name TEXT NOT NULL,\n    email TEXT UNIQUE,\n    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n\n-- Insert data\nINSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES\n    ('Alice', 'alice@example.com'),\n    ('Bob', 'bob@example.com');\n\n-- Query data\nSELECT name, COUNT(*) as count\nFROM users\nGROUP BY name\nHAVING count > 1;\n\n-- Join tables\nSELECT u.name, o.product\nFROM users u\nLEFT JOIN orders o ON u.id = o.user_id\nWHERE o.status = 'pending';\n```\n\nPython Integration:\n\n```python\nimport sqlite3\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport pandas as pd\n\nasync def query_database(db_path: Path, query: str) -> pd.DataFrame:\n    \"\"\"Execute SQL query and return results as DataFrame.\n\n    Args:\n        db_path: Path to SQLite database\n        query: SQL query to execute\n\n    Returns:\n        DataFrame with query results\n    \"\"\"\n    try:\n        conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)\n        return pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)\n    finally:\n        conn.close()\n\n# Example usage\ndb = Path('data.db')\ndf = await query_database(db, '''\n    SELECT date, COUNT(*) as count\n    FROM events\n    GROUP BY date\n''')\n```\n\nCommon Operations:\n\n1. **Database Management**\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Backup database\n   .backup 'backup.db'\n\n   -- Import CSV\n   .mode csv\n   .import data.csv table_name\n\n   -- Export results\n   .headers on\n   .mode csv\n   .output results.csv\n   SELECT * FROM table;\n   ```\n\n2. **Performance Optimization**\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Create index\n   CREATE INDEX idx_user_email ON users(email);\n\n   -- Analyze query\n   EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN\n   SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';\n\n   -- Show indexes\n   SELECT * FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='index';\n   ```\n\n3. **Data Analysis**\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Time series aggregation\n   SELECT\n       date(timestamp),\n       COUNT(*) as events,\n       AVG(duration) as avg_duration\n   FROM events\n   GROUP BY date(timestamp);\n\n   -- Window functions\n   SELECT *,\n       AVG(amount) OVER (\n           PARTITION BY user_id\n           ORDER BY date\n           ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW\n       ) as moving_avg\n   FROM transactions;\n   ```\n\nTools to work with SQLite:\n\n- [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/): Lightweight GUI\n- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/): Full-featured GUI\n- [sqlite-utils](https://sqlite-utils.datasette.io/): CLI tool\n- [Datasette](https://datasette.io/): Web interface",

        "clean_text": "## Unicode\n\nEver noticed when you copy-paste some text and get garbage symbols? Or see garbage when you load a CSV file? This video explains why. It covers how computers store text (called character encoding) and why it sometimes goes wonky.\n\nLearn about ASCII (the original 7-bit encoding system that could only handle 128 characters), why that wasn't enough for global languages, and how modern solutions like Unicode save the day by letting us use any character from any language.\n\nSome programs try to guess encodings (sometimes badly!). A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\n\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\n\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data. Here are key concepts you need to understand:\n\n- **Character Encodings**: Different ways to represent text in computers\n  - ASCII (7-bit): Limited to 128 characters, English-only\n  - UTF-8: Variable-width encoding, backwards compatible with ASCII\n  - UTF-16: Fixed-width encoding, used in Windows and Java\n  - UTF-32: Fixed-width encoding, memory inefficient but simple\n\nCommon encoding issues you'll encounter:\n\n```python\n# Reading files with explicit encoding\nwith open('file.txt', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n    text = f.read()\n\n# Handling encoding errors\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv', encoding='utf-8', errors='replace')\n\n# Detecting file encoding\nimport chardet\nwith open('unknown.txt', 'rb') as f:\n    result = chardet.detect(f.read())\nprint(result['encoding'])\n```\n\n[![Code Pages, Character Encoding, Unicode, UTF-8 and the BOM - Computer Stuff They Didn't Teach You #2 (17 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/jeIBNn5Y5fI/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/jeIBNn5Y5fI)",

It replaces tools like pip, conda, pipx, poetry, pyenv, twine, and virtualenv into one, enabling:\n\n- **Python Version Management**: uv installs and manages _multiple_ Python versions, allowing developers to specify and switch between versions seamlessly.\n- **Virtual Environment Handling**: It automates the creation and management of virtual environments, ensuring isolated and consistent development spaces for different projects.\n- **Dependency Management**: With support for the pyproject.toml format, uv enables precise specification of project dependencies. It maintains a universal lockfile, uv.lock, to ensure reproducible installations across different systems.\n- **Project Execution**: The `uv run` command allows for the execution of scripts and applications within the managed environment, streamlining development workflows.\n\nHere are some commonly used commands:\n\n```bash\n# Replace python with uv. This automatically installs Python and dependencies.\nuv run script.py\n\n# Run a Python script directly from the Internet\nuv run https://example.com/script.py\n\n# Run a Python script without installing\nuvx ruff\n\n# Use a specific Python version\nuv run --python 3.11 script.py\n\n# Add dependencies to your script\nuv add httpx --script script.py\n\n# Create a virtual environment at .venv\nuv venv\n\n# Install packages to your virtual environment\nuv pip install httpx\n```\n\nHere are some useful tools you can run with `uvx` without installation:\n\n```bash\nuvx --from jupyterlab jupyter-lab   # Jupyter notebook\nuvx marimo      # Interactive notebook\nuvx llm         # Chat with LLMs from the command line\nuvx openwebui   # Chat with LLMs via the browser\nuvx httpie      # Make HTTP requests\nuvx datasette   # Browse SQLite databases\nuvx markitdown  # Convert PDF to Markdown\nuvx yt-dlp      # Download YouTube videos\nuvx asciinema   # Record your terminal and play it\n```\n\nuv uses [inline script metadata](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/inline-script-metadata/#inline-script-metadata) for dependencies.\nThe eliminates the need for `requirements.txt` or virtual environments. For example:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# requires-python = \">=3.11\"\n# dependencies = [\n#   \"httpx\",\n#   \"pandas\",\n# ]\n# ///\n```\n\n[![uv - Python package and project management | Inline Script Metadata (28 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/igWlYl3asKw/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/igWlYl3asKw?t=1240)\n\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `uv run --with httpie -- https https://httpbin.org/get?email={email}` -->\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `uvx markitdown {email}.pdf` -->\n<!-- Assessment: Share output of `uv ruff format script.py` -->",

        "clean_text": "## Vector Databases\n\nVector databases are specialized databases that store and search vector embeddings efficiently.\n\nUse vector databases when your embeddings exceed available memory or when you want it run fast at scale. (This is important. If your code runs fast and fits in memory, you **DON'T** need a vector database. You can can use `numpy` for these tasks.)\n\nVector databases are an evolving space.\n\nThe first generation of vector databases were written in C and typically used an algorithm called [HNSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_navigable_small_world) (a way to approximately find the nearest neighbor). Some popular ones are:\n\n- **[chroma 19,637 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma)**\n- **[qdrant 23,341 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant)**\n- **[lancedb 6,327 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)**\n- **[faiss 34,684 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss)**\n- **[milvus 34,476 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus)**\n- **[weaviate 13,222 \u2b50 May 2025](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate)**\n\nIn addition, most relational databases now support vector search. For example:\n\n- **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`vss`](https://duckdb.org/docs/extensions/vss.html).\n- **[SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`sqlite-vec`](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec).\n- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**: Supports vector search with [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).\n\nTake a look at this [Vector DB Comparison](https://superlinked.com/vector-db-comparison).\n\nWatch this Vector Database Tutorial (3 min):\n\n[![Vector databases are so hot right now.

I evaluated from https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#2-cloud-platforms\n\n- AWS, Azure, Google Cloud are too complex for beginners\n- Cloudflare (next most popular, widely admired) Python support is in beta\n- Hetzner (most admired), Supabase (next most admired) do not have a serverless platform\n- Fly.io (next most admired) does not have a free tier\n- Heroku (used in previous terms) is the least admired\n- Vercel is both popular, admired, growing, has a free plan, and a simple API\n\n-->\n\nServerless platforms let you rent a single function instead of an entire machine. They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:\n\n- A contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\n- A tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\n- A chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\n- A newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\n- A webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\n\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\n\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\n\n- You can't `pip install` packages - you have to use `requirements.txt`\n- You can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\n- You can't run commands (e.g. `subprocess.run()`)\n\n[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) is a cloud platform optimized for frontend frameworks and serverless functions. Vercel is tightly integrated with GitHub. Pushing to your repository automatically triggers new deployments.\n\nHere's a [quickstart](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/python). [Sign-up with Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup). Create an empty `git` repo with this `api/index.py` file.\n\nTo deploy a FastAPI app, add a `requirements.txt` file with `fastapi` as a dependency.\n\n```text\nfastapi\n```\n\nAdd your FastAPI code to a file, e.g. `main.py`.\n\n```python\n# main.py\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"message\": \"Hello, World!\"}\n```\n\nAdd a `vercel.json` file to the root of your repository.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"builds\": [{ \"src\": \"main.py\", \"use\": \"@vercel/python\" }],\n  \"routes\": [{ \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"main.py\" }]\n}\n```\n\nOn the command line, run:\n\n- `npx vercel` to deploy a test version\n- `npx vercel --prod` to deploy to production\n\n**Environment Variables**. Use `npx vercel env add` to add environment variables. In your code, use `os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')` to access them.\n\n### Videos\n\n[![Vercel Product Walkthrough](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/sPmat30SE4k/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/sPmat30SE4k)\n\n[![Deploy FastAPI on Vercel | Quick and Easy Tutorial](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8R-cetf_sZ4/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8R-cetf_sZ4)",

For example:\n\n```bash\n# Download image and convert to base64 in one step\nIMAGE_BASE64=$(curl -s \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Correlation_coefficient.png\" | base64 -w 0)\n\n# Send to OpenAI API\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d @- << EOF\n{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\n      \"role\": \"user\",\n      \"content\": [\n        {\"type\": \"text\", \"text\": \"What is in this image?\"},\n        {\n          \"type\": \"image_url\",\n          \"image_url\": { \"url\": \"data:image/png;base64,$IMAGE_BASE64\" }\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\nEOF\n```",

([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro))\n- **Auto\u2011waiting & retry**: Built\u2011in locators reduce flakiness. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/locators))\n- **Multi\u2011browser support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit\u2014all from one API. ([playwright.dev](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/intro))\n\n### Example: Scraping a JS\u2011Rendered Site\n\nWe\u2019ll scrape [Quotes to Scrape (JS)](https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/)\u2014a site that loads quotes via JavaScript, so a simple `requests` call gets only an empty shell ([quotes.toscrape.com](https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/)). Playwright runs the scripts and gives us the real content:\n\n```python\n# /// script\n# dependencies = [\"playwright\"]\n# ///\n\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\ndef scrape_quotes():\n    with sync_playwright() as p:\n        # Channel can be \"chrome\", \"msedge\", \"chrome-beta\", \"msedge-beta\" or \"msedge-dev\".\n        browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True, channel=\"chrome\")\n        page = browser.new_page()\n        page.goto(\"https://quotes.toscrape.com/js/\")\n        quotes = page.query_selector_all(\".quote\")\n        for q in quotes:\n            text = q.query_selector(\".text\").inner_text()\n            author = q.query_selector(\".author\").inner_text()\n            print(f\"{text} \u2014 {author}\")\n        browser.close()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    scrape_quotes()\n```\n\nSave as `scraper.py` and run:\n\n```bash\nuv run scraper.py\n```\n\nYou\u2019ll see each quote plus author printed\u2014fetched only after the JS executes.",
